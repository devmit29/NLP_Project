          journal of nellie bly 1890before i went to england early in the year i had heard tales of the haunted moors of dartmoorthat bleak windswept land where strange creatures are said to roam on moonless nights butnothing prepared me for murder and science gone mad as men tempted the heavens by tryingto create in a test tube that which only god possesses the right to do        what i came to witness in these dark days was men of science crazed by their dementeddreams of creating something no other mortal has done it wasnt the first time murder andmadness was born in scientific experiments and like the question of the chicken and the eggi wonder—is it the science that drives men mad or do the scientists taint their formulas witha bit of their own insanity        was mary shelleys victor frankenstein insane to have brought the dead back to lifewith powerful jolts of electricity—or did the monster he created drive him mad when itbecame murderously uncontrollable        victor frankenstein warns another ambitious man of the dangers of trying to achievewhat no one else has ever accomplished calling his success a serpent that has stung him doyou share my madness have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught hear me let mereveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips        i have no doubt victor frankenstein would say that mr stevensons ambitious drjekyll actually was the murderous beast rather than the alter ego he created with a potion theviolent mr hyde        be what it may the matter that was to draw me into the dark side of science in the torsand crags of the moors began appropriately enough in a place of the dead                                      2                               london 1890i shiver as i leave a gloomy london day behind me and step into a dankmorgue near the banks of the river thames this small branch of hermajestys coroners office is on a wharf near london bridge in that areacalled the pool the busiest part of the biggest waterfront in the world     the breath of the dead in this examining room has a sharp edge to itsmelling like paint thinner poured over ice blocks of ice are scattered aboutthe room lowering the temperature to slow down decomposition of thebodies with the runoff from the ice and blood slipping through slats in thewood floor     after the first attack on my nose another smell is apparent hiddenunder the prickly acidic tang of cleaning fluid—death a bouquet ofdecomposing flesh blood and body fluids     in a curious way the chill air accented by the scent of blood and fleshremind me of a visit i made to a meatpacking plant in pittsburgh when iwent undercover to investigate the conditions comparing an animalslaughterhouse with an examining room for the dead is a gruesome thoughtusually im not this morbid but the unstirred cold air full of strange smellshas awakened the dark side of my imagination     my name is nellie bly im a crime reporter for the world mrpulitzers newspaper in new york city i came to london and this chamberof death not for a news story but to lay to rest a dear friend     the room had been washed down recently probably moments before istepped in because the slated wood floor is still wet the narrow openingson the floor permit whatever comes out of the bodies to flow into the riverand back to the sea the thought of human essence returning to the ocean isa comforting one since some say that life began in the sea but as i stand fora moment to let my eyes adjust to the gloom of the windowless room thesmell of the thames—poisoned by the noxious wastes of man andmachines—rises to become a dominant stench in the room      the river stinks worse than the dead inspector abberline sayssorry that was badly thought out wasnt it      the scotland yard inspector who i met the previous year when i wasin london following a lead on a murder case1 gives me a look of concernas he hands me a vinegarscented nosegay meant to stun my sense of smell      i put it in my lace hankie but dont put it up to my nose i am here for adear friend and i dont want my senses muted      butcherblock slabs are set out in two rows a dozen on each side likebeds in a hospital ward wood is a cheap but an unfortunate choice formorgue tables because it stains white sheets many stained with blood andother body fluids are tossed haphazardly over bodies not being worked on      inspector abberline had entered before me to prepare the room formy visit—covering the naked dead lest they offend my fragile feminineconstitution i could have told him that i had already seen things in my lifethat no woman—or man—should have seen      from the appearance of the bodies that are not covered most of themhad been pulled from the river already in an advanced state ofdecomposition like new york citys waterways the thames is not agentle environment for human flesh one wonders how the poor fishsurvive      im grateful that most of the bodies are sheeted hiding the cruelties ofman machine or that done by their own hand i have been in morgueswhere bodies are left uncovered lined up like dead fish ready to be gutted      a woman dressed in widows black from bonnet to shoes is sittingnext to a male body on the first slab in the room her head drifts down andthen jerks back up as she fights dozing off a bell tied to the mans wristtells me that shes his wife or other close relative there for the waitingthe procedure occurs when the morgue attendants are not entirely certainthat the man is dead rather than risk burying him alive the bell is placedon his wrist for twentyfour hours if it rings he will be transferred to ahospital rather than the cemetery      my heart goes out to the woman she is a lonely figure full of hopethat has little promise      two tables down from her an attendant wearing a white cloth apron isscrubbing a male body dipping his bloody rag into a bucket and bringing itback bloodred water flying off the rag as it is pulled out of the pailsplashing on the floor and draining through the slats into the river      against the back wall are wood shelves with knives scalpels sawsand other medical instruments and supplies a small cart next to it is piledhigh with dirty bloody rags and clothing      as a crime reporter i have been in morgues before so as my eyessweep this room i recognize that its not a fully functional coronersexamination room despite some of the tools of the trade on the shelvesrather than doctors with saws and knives cutting into bodies or testing vialsof blood for poisons in a hunt for a cause of death i see only dienersmorgue assistants whose duties are to handle and clean the bodies      inspector abberline catches my look at the dieners and reads mythought if theres a serious issue about the cause of death the body istaken to the central morgue for examination most of the poor souls in heregave up the ghost voluntarily or were hastened to their maker by a bluntinstrument in a dark alley so theres no reason for further investigation      kind man that he is he avoids using the word suicide but that is whyi am in this chilly purgatory that is a temporary repose for bodies fished outof the river before finding a permanent place six feet under      something about the dieners with their white cloth aprons stainedwith blood is familiar to me but my thoughts are too crowded with keepingmy feelings under control to put it together the cloth aprons are somethingof a puzzle because the morgue attendants ive seen in the past had wornrubber ones      the remains of hailey mcguire are at the end of the line inspectorabberline says      the remains of hailey mcguire      a few weeks ago i knew a lovely young woman with that name full oflife and spirit the spirit has escaped for what i hope is a better place andnow her name is simply the inscription on a morgue toe tag attached to abody that constitutes the remains she left behind      i can see at a glance that almost all of the bodies in the room are malewhich is to be expected for a morgue on the docks i imagine mostly sailorsfishermen and dockworkers along with an occasional prostitute arebrought here hailey was none of these but people driven to end their livesnot infrequently find their way to water      hailey suicide how sad that is how hard it is to believe      the inspector gives me another concerned look and gently takes myarm were almost there      i give him an im okay smile as we make our way down the path ofthe dead      a gruesome thought that comes to mind is unavoidable one day thegray corpse of nellie bly linked to the name by only a toe tag will be anempty carcass in a place like this i just hope my spirit will have moved onto what i sincerely pray is a better place and not hot as hell—if you knowwhat i mean      the inspector hadnt wanted me to view the body not even after it istransferred to a funeral home these cases where the body has been inwater are best laid to rest with a closed casket viewing hed said but ifeel that i would be cowardly if i avoided seeing my friend and holding herhand as i say goodbye she has no one else      we pass a man who i take from his mackintosh and high rubber bootsto be a fisherman as he bends over a male body perhaps that of a shipmatewhose last port of call was davy joness locker the fisherman is puttingcoins on the eyelids of his mate      paying toll to the ferryman inspector abberline says      i know the superstition a payment to charon the boatman whoferries the souls of the dead across the river styx in the underworld is howmy mother explained it to me when my father died i was six and an oldfriend of his bent over the coffin before it was lowered into the ground toplace coins on my fathers eyes      im sorry      i can only nod my head in thanks for i still miss my father dearly andthe memory of his interment hits me hard as i see the fisherman placing thecoins it had been a rainy gray day with a deepbone chill in the air notunlike the funeral atmosphere i find today in london seeing the cold stiffpallor on my fathers face scarred me making it difficult for me to dealwith death      the coarse brutal man my poor mother married in desperation to keepus children fed after my fathers untimely death had made the scar apermanent open wound when he forced me to watch a cow beingslaughtered when i was a young teenager im making you tough is whathe said but i knew he was being cruel and mean because he found pleasurein playing the bully     i try to put aside those bitter memories as we come to a covered bodyon the last slab in the line     a diener wearing a fouled white apron stands by on the other side ofthe table waiting for us hes overweight with large jowls that quiver as hepurses his lips he slaps a fly off his cheek and looks to the inspector forpermission to remove the sheet     my knees start shaking and my heart jumps into my throat                                      3just a few weeks ago i was in manhattan covering a story about the sextrafficking of young girls from the orient when mr cockerill the managingeditor of mr pulitzers newspaper called me into his office      you need to sit down was the first thing he told me thisproclamation coming in the tone that something was desperately wrongalarmed me my first thought was that something had happened to mymother who lives with me      hailey mcguire committed suicide      he had been right i needed to be sitting when i heard the news      hailey was not just a dear friend but a young woman who like mehad struggled hard to get a job in the male dominated world of newspaperreporting a product of an orphanage without even a high school diplomahailey had been destined for work as a household servant or worse theterrible life of a prostitute having fought tooth and nail to break intoreporting and having left high school myself before completion because ofa heart problem2 i empathized with haileys struggles      actually i was the person who first directed her toward working as areporter after watching her testify at a court trial i was covering two yearsago      the criminal case was against a man who owned a service that referredhousehold servants he was accused of raping a young girl who had appliedfor servant work hailey had also applied through the agency and testifiedin court that the man had indecently touched her and she had fought back toavoid being raped      as i watched her on the witness stand reading from a narration givingthe precise time date and details of the incident i realized her descriptionof what had happened sounded like the newspaper articles i write—evendown to the rocky grammar my first editor said i had      i spoke to her after court and began giving her small assignments tohelp me gather information and was delighted when she came back with notjust what i had asked her for but information that showed she had a nosefor the news      expending no less energy and determination than hercules had done inperforming his twelve labors i managed to get mr pulitzer to take haileyon as a cub reporter running errands in the newsroom and finally getting herown beat at the criminal courts building      both cockerill and pulitzer with their instinctively negative view ofwomen in the workplace had been hesitant first about hiring and thenpromoting hailey finding her too softhearted for crime reporting idisagreed and didnt want to see her pigeonholed into reporting aboutweddings and funerals the only jobs open for women in news reporting—and even then few were filled by women      she gets too emotionally involved with people shes reporting aboutcockerill complained      thats what makes her a good reporter i said knowing it was onlypartly true injustices needed to be reported with an impassioned appeal forthe victims but a reporter has to remain a neutral observer while gatheringthe story i admit that i dont have a talent for keeping my feelings to myselfat any stage of the process but i didnt see her getting worked upemotionally when dealing with wrongs      she knows how victims of crimes hurt because of her ownbackground i reminded cockerill      hailey had not been born an orphan she became parentless at the ageof five when her stepfather bludgeoned her mother to death in front of herhitting her mother over and over with a short club until the womans facewas a bloody pulp and hailey had passed out on the floor after begging andscreaming for him to stop      i rejected cockerills accusation that my experience with my ownstepfather against whom i had testified in court about the cruel treatment hegave to my mother and us children was affecting my judgment      she can do the job i said      i was right—and i was sadly mistaken      yes like me she had a nose for the news and was instinctively drawnto battle injustice but i was able to remain impartial while doing a storynever stepping over the boundaries and getting emotionally involved eventhough i might cry into my pillow at night for what i saw and reportedduring the day      unfortunately hailey stepped over the line when interviewing awoman on trial for stabbing her abusive husband as he was beating her thepolice commissioner approached mr pulitzer with suspicion that afterhailey had interviewed the woman a number of times in jail he believedshe aided the woman by retrieving the murder weapon a kitchen knifefrom where the woman had hidden it she dropped it in the east riverduring a ferry ride the commissioner said—but couldnt prove it      hailey denied the allegation but mr pulitzer wasnt 100 percentconvinced of her innocence because the battered womans situation was tooclose for comfort to haileys own trauma i wasnt convinced either      if hailey had crossed the line she would end up in prison for hernäïveté i didnt believe she would lie to me if i asked her right out so ididnt ask and refused to discuss the situation with her when she appearedready to take me into her confidence      to avoid very bad publicity if one of his reporters ended up in jail foraiding and abetting a murder mr pulitzer whose heart beats with exactlythe same rhythm as the circulations of his newspapers decided to take nochances he buried the problem by sending hailey off to london totemporarily fill the shoes of the papers london correspondent when theman returned to new york with a medical problem      the correspondents job was mostly to cable home stories reported bybritish papers rather than hoofing it to old bailey and parliament to findnews so there was little opportunity for her to get personally involved in astory there was also little chance that hailey would find her job waitingfor her when she returned to new york after the heat over the murder casehad cooled      after telling me that hailey had killed herself cockerill had gotten tohis feet and began pacing he does not have an easy job mr pulitzer is aruthless taskmaster even going to the extreme of employing two men to dothe same job to see which one would pass mr darwins test of survival ofthe fittest      he wants you to get over to london and make sure that your frienddidnt leave any dirty laundry behind      still stunned by haileys death i just stared at him he of course wasmr pulitzer and by calling hailey my friend meant that any dirtylaundry i couldnt clean up would be dumped at my door      i warned him not to send her to london he continued who knowswhat happened over there to cause her to kill herself she wasnt quitebalanced the job was too big for her to handle being raw in the businessand all this is your fault you know she was your protégé      all but his last words had to fight their way through the haze id falleninto when he told me hailey was dead your fault were hot burning wordsthat made me want to cry      adding to the emotional trauma of haileys death was the fact that iam still agitated by what i consider to be mr pulitzers cavalier treatment ofme after i sent the papers circulation figures soaring a few months ago as iraced around the world to beat the record of jules vernes character inaround the world in eighty days3 i would have quit on the spot had myconcern not been to protect haileys memory she was a wonderful personand i was not about to let another reporter trash her name or mine as heradvocate      i left his office fighting back tears walking through the newsroom thatsuddenly became quiet as i entered reporters looked up and then backdown to avoid making eye contact while a couple of them so jealous of mysuccess in their old boys club of reporting that they openly smirked atme but i didnt give them any satisfaction of witnessing a femalebreakdown instead i walked past each and every one of them with myhead held high and my features showing nothing but determination until imade it to the ladies powder room then i burst into tears      i cried for hailey but i was racked with guilt did i drive the pooryoung woman to kill herself because i kept pushing her to jump hurdles thatshe was incapable of leaping      i sat on a toilet twisting my handkerchief around my right index fingeruntil it was red and throbbing from pain mr cockerill didnt have to orderme to go to london if anything it was vital i went i had to make surehailey was properly laid to rest and not thrown in a paupers gravesandwiched between strangers      i also prayed to god that i would prove that they were wrong abouthaileys too gentle disposition and that my insistence on pushing her intothe line of fire as a reporter hadnt so shattered her fragile disposition thatshe came to believe killing herself was less painful than facing life      nellie inspector abberlines voice brought me back to this horriblereality      i gasp as the sheet comes off and i stare into the terrible face of deathwhat chance good lady hath bereft you thus                                                —john milton comus                                      4it isnt hailey at least not the vibrant happy intelligent young woman iknew instead it is a body remains corpse deceased the departed it isbloated corpulent with the bloodless pale complexion of a fishs belly      jesus—joseph—and mary i uncontrollably exclaim im sorry itell inspector abberline and the morgue assistant who has thrown the sheetback over the body it—it caught me by surprise      the inspector takes my arm come dear well talk outside      i shake my head and pull away from the compassionate mans gripno its my duty to her to see this through i cleared my throat how dowe know that—she—is hailey for certain      inspector abberline pulls a charm bracelet out of his pocket and handsit to me recognize this      yes      the bracelet has two dangling objects—a tag with her name scratchedon it and a statue of liberty trinket      i found it curious a young woman of her status as a reporter wouldwear something this uh inexpensive he says      cheap is a better word for it theyre sold by street vendors at thedock where the boat to the statue of liberty boards its tourist junk but ithad great meaning to her you see hailey was an orphan when she waseleven she was sent to work as a household servant she worked long hoursand no matter how it was figured what they charged her for board androom always exceeded the pittance they paid her      sounds like she was indentured      exactly like a slave it happens all the time because orphanages areovercrowded she finally broke loose and moved into a settlement house forimpoverished young women picking up work wherever she could to herthat trip to liberty island which she paid for with her earnings wasconfirmation of her success she took the trip after she got her firstreporting job i choke up and cant admit that i had gotten her the job      inspector abberline pretends to busy himself looking at the bracelet togive me a chance to compose myself      there was a ring too i point at the other side of the shrouded formon the other hand please let me have it      my request is to the assistant the ring with a fake emerald made ofglass is on her right hand it is the only other piece of jewelry i knew her towear i had bought it for her last birthday i want the ring to remember herby its not valuable that is said to assure the morgue worker that i wontbe taking something of value he could have poached off the body himself      he gives the inspector a look and abberline nods the assistant pullsback the sheet just enough to expose the hand its on the fingers arebloated      no i gasp as he takes his knife to cut off the finger no leave iton      before we leave snip the ring off with a cutter inspector abbelinetells the diener you can have the band repaired by a jeweler he says tome      no let it stay with her i feel queasy and weakkneed but regain myequilibrium i meet the dieners eye i will check to make sure its therewhen she is laid to rest      are you certain that its her ring inspector abberline asks      yes i bought it for her why      just an added point of confirmation that confirms identity we havethe bracelet ring and a suicide note the name on the bracelet led us to herrooming house where we found the note shed left out several days offood for her cat and asked in the note that her landlady find a good homefor the cat      what else did the note say      its in the file at my desk so this isnt verbatim but she said … i amso sorry life is no longer worth living hes left me and i have nothing tolive for i feel so lost alone there is no way i can go back to america thethought of prison … no i cant go back i have no place to go and no one tolive for whoever finds this note please make sure my cat is given a lovinghome she also left money for cat food on her dresser by the note      killing herself in despair over a man i dont know how to fit it in withmy memory of hailey she was emotional but i have a hard time coming togrips with her taking her own life for a romance gone sour      she has a birthmark i almost forgot about it      where      behind her right ear a red mark about the size of a shilling betweenher ear and hairline she always pulled her hair forward to cover the ear      i turn away as the sheet is removed and turn back around after i hearthe diener say dont see a mark      can you show me where you remember it      forcing myself i bend down closer and look its not there      inspector abberline strikes a match and uses it to take a look yourecertain it was there      absolutely she used to joke and call it the mark of cain      couldve been washed away by her time in the water the morgueassistant says      quite so inspector abberline agrees      i—ive never heard of that my thoughts are jumbled by the lack ofa mark birthmarks are imperfections in the skin not a stain that can bewashed away      quite true but her body has been bleached as well as it might be hadit been laying in a washtub the rivers so sour it could peel the hide off arhino      i dont know … i just dont understand it i stare down at the bloatedface trying to find hailey in it wait i bend down to get a closer look ather head what is this      a wound the diener says      how did she get it on her head i look to inspector abberline      she most likely hit a rock when she threw herself into the river      or the diener adds it couldve been caused by the impact ofhitting the water if she jumped from a bridge or a passing boat could haveknocked her      the inspector nods to the diener to cover the body and takes mefirmly by the arm back down the path of the dead      i dont understand it i repeat i dont see hailey killing herself oversome man who—      she was pregnant      what i stop and stare at him     nellie dear i didnt want to tell you and color your memory of thesweet girl she didnt tell you anything about it     only that she had met a man she had fallen in love with on myvoyage to england i had kept reading over and over the last letter ireceived from hailey she was all excited about a new beau and how muchthey were in love but she had not given a clue as to who he is     do you know who the father was i ask     he shrugs dont know and wont ever know most likely a marriedman not an uncommon situation he gives me a look or an uncommonchoice for the woman to make     he is right frightfully so that it shakes me to my roots there isnowhere for a pregnant young woman without some means of support to goexcept the foul conditions of a poorhouse     i knew hailey she would never return to that life she would ratherdie than end up back in a house for paupers or worse watch her babystarve

         5a cool breeze off the waters of the broad river thames is welcome as icome up the steps from the mortuary and into fresh air when i arrivedearlier the air had that fouled saltwater smell of waterlogged docks fishingboats and coalburning steam ships even though the great port of london ismany miles from the north sea after experiencing a dank taste of a placeof the dead the salty air is a perfume to me      the hansom cab i had arrived in is waiting for me the driver chattingand smoking with the driver of a freight wagon who is adjusting his horsebindings i shake my head letting my cabbie know im not ready to leave iwant to thank inspector abberline for taking the time to accompany me tothe remains of hailey he stayed behind to fill out a form releasing the bodyto a mortuary he assured me would treat hailey with respect i will contactthem to make the arrangements      the thick gray clouds give the impression of a massive dark blankethanging over my head like a shroud—a perfect atmosphere to fit my mood      a sudden wind comes off the water gathering packing materials lyingoutside a warehouse sending the rubbish swirling around just like thethoughts in my head guilt frustration helplessness anger sadness      my thoughts are a jumble and i need to clear them      suicide …      i truly hate this feeling of frustration and guilt how do people copewith suicide      my mind still rebels at the thought that hailey was so desperate soalone that she took her own life i experienced a sense of guilt from themoment i had heard the news but now i am also angry at myself forpushing her when she wasnt ready to be a reporter infuriated too at thelover who stole her innocence and then cast her out      if he had only cast her out—and hadnt murdered her to keep her quieti know where the thought comes from its that old familiar voice in myhead that is always far too suspicious of the dark hearts of others i mustaccept the fact my friend killed herself but paranoia is almost on the list ofmy faults though ive found most of the paranoia ive experienced assimply being heightened awareness      the fact she was pregnant and suffered a blow to the head raised theshort hairs on my paranoia bedeviling me also is the primal instinct in mygut telling me that suicide just doesnt fit haileys excited energetic loveoflife personality      still i have to listen to the other voice in my head the one that isometimes try to ignore but which is calmer and more analytical than theone in my gut and it is saying that hailey was gullible and impressionableand impulsive—a young woman who would often leap first and thinkafterward      that she would get emotionally involved and make love out ofwedlock with the threat of pregnancy is in line with how i see her evenwith a married man i ask myself as impulsive and emotional as haileycan be yes even with a married man      shame on any man who impregnates a woman and leaves herdisgraced and a burden on our society—if they dont end up in a river or ahouse of prostitution      the more i think about it the more tempted i am to track down themarried scoundrel who destroyed her life and write an exposé on the abuseof impressionable young women by older married men      with my anger rising i mosey away from the morgue trying toseparate my thoughts from what i saw in there and what i would do to theman who caused her death i should return to new york rather than wreakvengeance on haileys seducer there is much to occupy ones attention onthe docks boxes of cargo are coming out of the holes of ships in greatnetted bundles and set down on the dock where swarms of dockworkerspack them away onto wagons and into warehouses      down the wharf is a forest of tall masts and smokestacks black fromthe coal burned in their steam engines i see bales of tobacco from virginiacoming off a yankee clipper ship beef from argentina being unloaded froma freighter whose name should be bucket of rust blocks of ice from anorwegian ship moving down a long slide disappearing into an icehouse      the slide is several stories high leading out to a wharf where the iceblocks are coming out the hole of the ship as the cargo net with a singlelarge block sits down on the slide a man on each side uses hooks on longpoles to pull the block free of the thick rope netting and send it skiddingdown the ramp      convenient—an icehouse next to the mortuary      on my way back i realize that on the other side of the mortuary is ameatpacking plant where according to the sign in front argentine beef isprocessed i find it distasteful that the mortuary is so close to aslaughterhouse      putting a morgue between a meatpacking house and an icehouse on abusy dock offends my sense of order in the world and respect for the deadthe chinese would say the morgues position is not an auspicious settingfor a place of the dead that its not feng shui correct because it isnt inharmony with the hustle and bustle of its surroundings      the workers on the docks also strike me as a rather depressing lot notunlike how they are on the docks in new york there is a horribleexploitation of cheap labor for handling cargo with immigrants fromireland and other countries brought in to keep a constant force ofbackbreaking labor to add insult to injury they are housed in terribleconditions and work for long hours for starvation wages      seeing how truly ragged some of the dockworkers are and havingpassed en route to the docks poor neighborhoods with shoeless childrenlooking dirty and malnourished adds to my sense of how unjust the worldis in distributing wealth      some of the workers wear the tattered uniforms of workhouses thosepoorhouses where paupers are taken in and sent out to work for their boardand stay in dormitories where husbands wives and even their children arehoused in separate buildings the atmosphere is grim and intimidating withworkhouse inmates treated not unlike prisoners—men and women onadmission are stripped searched washed and have their hair cut work istedious and laborious living conditions disgusting reminding me of thesmall boy in charles dickenss novel oliver twist who lived in aworkhouse—poor miserable and always hungry      thinking about the haves and have nots and my own miserable yearsas a factory girl but fortunate as a woman to even have gotten a job where iwas paid far less than the men doing the same tasks i am lost in a brownstudy when i hear a shrill cry and look up to a raven on a lamppost      wonderful i tell him how appropriate did you come by to tauntme with nevermore      it appears he did inspector abberline says behind me a victoriacarriage bearing a door insignia of the metropolitan police servicecommonly called scotland yard has arrived as the inspector approachesme he looks up from reading a missive apparently delivered by the policeuniformed driver      and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shallbe lifted nevermore he continues my favorite poem he waves one ofthe messages hes holding my commissioner needs to communicate withthe new york city police department regarding miss mcguires passingwe received a query concerning whether she had mentioned anything abouther actions in the new york matter in her suicide note she hadnt      has her uh letter been examined by a handwriting expert icouldnt bring myself to say suicide note      i examined it ive had a bit of experience looking over such thingsby comparing it to her handwriting its quite easy to see that it was done byher own hand she wrote with something of an excited flourish that wouldnot be easy to duplicate had the note been very short say just a sentence iwould have had an expert examine it but it would be very difficult andtime consuming for even a clever forger to get close to a personshandwriting style when dealing with that much writing      i know hes right hes a good policeman who wouldnt be fooled by aforgery but before i return to new york ill sweet talk him into letting mesee the note anyway still i need to ask him about fingerprinting      i just wish you could check for fingerprints      really … so you know about dr henry fauldss awkward conceptfor identifying criminals      yes      im impressed      i hold my chin an inch higher i revel in it when i surprise peopleespecially men with knowledge they dont think a woman would have      then you know the method of identification was dismissed by ourmetropolitan police five years ago      yes and i think its a shame its quite a clever idea taking a personsfingerprints with printing ink and using them for identification do youknow how dr faulds discovered this      no do tell      while accompanying a friend to an archaeological dig he noticed insome ancient clay fragments that the delicate impressions left by workerscould be detected with the human eye he decided to examine his ownfingertips and then compared them to those of his friends each pattern ofridges was uniquely different      interesting abberline says however when he presented his theoryto the commissioner his evidence didnt show that prints are always uniqueto a person or that they can be practically classified and thats just naming afew holes in his notion he eyes me gravely you must accept that yourfriend killed herself      its doesnt even look like her      nellie she was in the water for at least a week i hate to bring this upbut you saw her face its awful what water does to a body and then youhave the fish and…      stop please i understand      im sorry that was insensitive of me      no youre correct      i look down at the ground i wish i could erase that moment when isaw haileys bloated face      he takes my arm and leads me toward the carriages my job as apoliceman would often be simpler if we were able to identify criminals andtheir victims with fingerprints      he has changed the subject deliberately and i welcome it i ask himdid you know that while dr faulds was living in japan his hospital wasbroken into and the police arrested a staff member      he shakes his head i know very little about the mans background      dr faulds thought the man was innocent and he compared thefingerprints left behind at the crime scene to the man they arrested and theywere completely different he was released      very good      it puzzles me that police agencies are still dismissing hisfingerprinting method      because we would have to have everyone in the worlds fingerprintsto make his method useable and that is impracticable and impossible hepauses and gives me another look of concern dont think of the situationas the loss of a friend she is gone and that is her choice and she is nolonger suffering the mental maladies that caused her sorrow shes at peacenow     i give inspector abberline a peck on the cheek youre right     he turns beet red and clears his throat with a guttural rumble nownellie dear please let me drop you off at your hotel we have thecommissioners own fancy carriage he indicates the victoria a fourwheeled carriage with a calash top a seat for two passengers and a perch infront for the bobby driver     thanks but i need to drop by haileys old office on fleet street tosee what needs tending to     ill drop you off and on the way you can look at haileys suicidenote     i thought it was at your office     i knew you would want to see it so i requested it be brought here     i do want to see it but i know in my heart it will throw out thepossibility that haileys death was not by her own hand i dont know if imready for that     shall we go     of course     before we pull away a man comes out of the slaughterhouse next tothe morgue and goes inside he has a bloody apron on and a saw in hishand     now i remember what the morgue attendants and their apronsreminded me of—the pittsburgh meatpacking house i had done a story on     change of shift i ask the inspector                                      6my hands are shaking as i hold haileys suicide note inspector abberline isgracious enough to turn his head and look out the window      if anyone can recognize haileys handwriting its me ive seen enoughof it i believe that inspector abberline has alternative motives for gettingthe suicide note to me he also wants to make sure its haileys because ofmy reluctance like he said to me at the morgue just an added point ofconfirmation that confirms her identity…      i take a deep breath and look down oh no      its not haileys handwriting      no … its hers      he nods his head and looks back out the window      tears roll down my cheek as i read her letter i am so sorry for what iam about to do but my life is no longer worth living hes left me and ihave nothing to live for i feel so lost alone i dont know what to do thereis no way i can go back to america i cant bear the thought of prison no icant and i wont go back i have no place to go and no one to live for thereis only one thing i can do whoever finds this note please make sure my catis given a loving home hailey mcguire                                       7archer stands near the corner of fleet street and hood court as he watchesthe entrance to the international news building halfway down the street heis waiting for a woman he has never seen in person before      a cautious man he occasionally opens up a newspaper to look at asketch of the woman he is on the lookout for the story about the woman inthe paper is not current news but a report months earlier on the progressamerican reporter nellie bly was making in her race around the world      archer stamps his feet trying to keep the blood flowing it is a cooldamp day with the overcast acting as a ceiling to trap the cold wet air      he would not have noticed the chill in the air if he had been walkinginstead of standing around waiting and watching he can feel middle agecreeping up on him with arthritic pain starting at the bottom of his oftenaching feet now that he went everywhere by shanks mare no longer able toafford cabs thanks to his dear exwife who not only put him in thissituation but once the money stopped coming in she upped and left somegratitude      for years he lavished her with expensive clothing even those sillyfancy hats she wore like she was going to a garden party or something abig apartment dinners out in better restaurants than either of them had everbeen in before even going to plays like they were real gentry … then whenhes ratted out by his fellow policemen at the metropolitan police servicefor having his hand out too often she leaves      women … trouble thats what they are nothing but trouble      a street vendor is selling roasted chestnuts on the corner thechestnuts are roasting on a rack over a bed of hot coals in a halfmetalbarrow set atop a rollaway cart      the warm smell of the chestnuts breezes over to archer and he steps tothe vendor and holds out his hand with a piece of newspaper on it      the peddler gives a look at archers worn suit that needs sponging offand a hot iron at his soiled collar the slightly turned rim on his bowler hatand his scuffed shoes he puts two chestnuts on it      four archer says      the man puts two more on four pence      police archer says stepping away      youre not a copper anymore i know who you are the vendorgrabs the poker he uses to stir the coals with and takes a step toward archer      back off archer hisses pulling back his coat exposing a knife in asheath hanging from his belt the only good thing he acquired as adockworker after he was ousted from being a cop a pity job is what hiswife called it just before she left him and she was right his cousin a leadman on the docks got it for him archer hated it but handling cargo gavehim eating money      the vendor returns to his chestnuts muttering curses your kind spitsin the soup to spoil it for everyone else      archer ignores the man as his attention is drawn to a woman gettingout of a carriage in front of the building he glances back at the newspapersketch of nellie bly and then at the woman as she disappears through theentrance      certain it is her and that she will be in the building for a time hemoseys away toward a tea shop where he will muscle a cup of tea andbiscuits much like he did the chestnuts      old habits are hard to stop besides he enjoys exerting the privilegeshe had when he carried a detectives badge it had made up for the lousypay      hes elated that hes been hired to do something easier and betterpaying than carrying cargo like a mule following the american womansince she got off the boat from america has gotten him enough for a goodbit of beef and gin and his instincts are telling him that there is a lot more tobe made      hell be back watching the entrance when she comes out his workwith her is just beginning if he plays it right he will be back on top again                                      8as the carriage pulls away i stand on fleet street the hub of londonsnewspaper world      in new york the major papers have similarly gathered along parkrow which is nicknamed newspaper row mr pulitzer and otherpublishers claim they put their papers there to be close to city hall but italso proves convenient for their reporters to spy on what the other papersare drumming up as with thieves there is no honor among reporters whenit comes to gathering news      even before i enter i know that behind the goodnatured bonhomienewspeople maintain publicly toward each other the true atmosphere of theplace will be cutthroat and secretive—whoever has a door locks it whenthey leave those only with a desk lock that too      the international news building houses correspondents from justabout everywhere that can be reached by the worlds undersea cables andoverland telegraph networks it even has its own cable office hummingwith messages sent off across the channel to paris berlin and rome tonew york on the other side of the atlantic and as far away as bombayhong kong and tokyo      it is truly a miracle of modern science that a reporter can send a storythat will travel several thousand miles under the sea by cable and then racemore thousands of miles on telegraph lines strung on poles across thecontinent to a newspaper in san francisco      sadly my presence at this building is not to send exciting reports ofwars and the rise and fall of empires but to dispose of any confidentialinformation on the news stories hailey might have left behind      the worlds regular correspondent will be back in a few days to keepthe news moving in the meantime mr pulitzer has arranged for acorrespondent from another of his newspapers the st louis postdispatchto also cover for the world      i hesitate hating to go in and rummage through haileys office i feellike a child whos been dropped off at school and doesnt want to enter alittle rain has begun to fall more of a mist than drops i wish it would pourso no one would know ive been crying       first i had to see haileys body and say goodbye to her then i readher suicide note and now i have to leaf through her work sometimes i hatelife       lets get this over with i mumble to myself as i reluctantly enter thebuilding       the newsroom before me is a familiar one not unlike the large baywhere reporters hug desks at the world—there is also the same cloud ofpipe and cigar smoke hovering and the sharp reek of tobacco smoke alongwith spittoons that need a good cleaning like most males of the speciesreporters—almost all of whom are men—believe they have a godgivenright to foul the air and spit disgusting juices at brass spittoons missingoften       a few cubicles along the wall offer some privacy and for the biggestnewspapers a category in which the world falls a stairway to the rightleads up to a balcony lined with doors to small offices i already know thathaileys office will be on the second floor       another common feature of the newsroom is a railing keeping peopleout and a person i call the gatekeeper posted next to the swinging gate tobar entry to all but the privileged       to get my first reporting job i had to make a mad dash past thenewsrooms guardian and through the worlds gate rushing into the officewhere i confronted mr pulitzer and mr cockerill with my plan to prove icould be a reporter by spending ten days in the madhouse for women onblackwells island       i will never forget that day in new york       i was penniless and desperate for work for four months since arrivingfrom pittsburgh pennsylvania i went to every newspaper on park row andwas rejected by them all and to make matters worse the night beforeseeing mr pulitzer my purse was stolen in central park while walkinghome leaving me without a cent that morning i not only borrowed a coatfrom my landlady but cab fare       determined to get an audience with mr pulitzer who had just returnedto new york from abroad filled with pride and persistence i hurriedthrough the newsroom i was not about to go back home defeated instead iplowed through like a steadfast ship its bow breaking water keeping mychin high and carefully lifting my skirt off the floor at least an inch to keepthe bottom from being fouled by tobacco juice that didnt reach thespittoons      my heart had been pounding and i was thrilled to have stepped into arealm where stories of life and death the stock market running amuck fameand disgrace came to life as reporters yelled back and forth at their editorsand a boy ran up and down the aisle grabbing copies from the reporters sothey could rush them to the copy editors      nothing has changed      now over three years later and having earned my salt with storieswritten down the street and around the world i still must face the stares ofseveral dozen men as i a woman dare to invade their territory      once again i put my chin up an extra inch but i cant help wonderhow hailey took the animosity and joking here in london i had alreadybroken in the newsmen in new york to a feminine presence so she didntface as much prejudice as she would have had to experience here      their stares and jabs would probably make someone as sensitive ashailey feel like she was walking onto the battlefield with bullets flying allaround her—a reflection that hits me again with my editors assertion thatshe hadnt been ready for a newspaper reporting job especially in londonthe hub of the newspaper world for all of europe      having to walk past these men every day without having provenherself capable of doing the job as i did with a sensational story wouldchip away at any persons soul no matter how strong they are and haileywas innocent in a beautiful soft way      may i help you madam a young man sitting behind the desk asks      yes im from the world in new york im going to our office here      you must be nellie bly      yes i am how did you—      recognize you from a newspaper clipping hailey—miss mcguirehad she spoke of you often im very sorry about—about what happenedthe young man stammers and blushes then gets up to hold open the gatefor me its a pleasure meeting you      thank you      if i can assist you in any way please let me know      a thought hangs with me as i go up the stairs hailey was a bright andattractive young woman and pregnant knowing hailey the young mandoesnt appear to be a candidate for her lover … but he might have gottenclose to her or even simply went out of his way to observe her i must stopand chat some more with him on my way out because he might be a wealthof information      with a key i brought from new york i unlock the door and enter      the room is a cubbyhole big enough for a rolltop desk against thewall to my right three wooden filing cabinets against the wall to the leftand a dirty window allowing a bit of dull gray light in between      beside the office door is a metal umbrella stand that has one largeblack umbrella in it above it is an empty wooden coatrack with a mans hatand a rain slicker      a chair on rollers is in front of the desk a bookcase and stacks andstacks of faded newspapers and newspaper clippings occupy every spacesomething else isnt taking up even the filing cabinets are piled high withnewspapers cobwebs make up the rest of the furnishings i just pray nospider rears his ugly head while im here i hate spiders      on top of the desk is a soft blue vase filled with pink roses haileysway to add cheer and femininity to this cluttered messy male office that isladen with the heavy smell of tobacco smoke imbedded in the wood      the roses are wilted i wish i had new ones to replace them i hatelooking at the dead roses—they speak of haileys death but they werehaileys and i am not prepared to trash them      i roll up the top of the desk shoved into the back right corner is a piperack holding four pipes next to it is a closed roundmetal tin that containstobacco the desk has coffee mug marks cigarette burns and ink stains allthe signature of the correspondent who regularly occupies the office      the desktop is cleared of most paperwork which surprises me becausetheres only a small space to lay items and hailey wasnt better than anyother newspaper person myself included in keeping manageable the notespictures and other items we gather for stories      either hailey wasnt working on any stories for sometime leading upto her death or she came to the office and cleaned up her desk before killingherself      she was an orderly person and it isnt beyond the realm ofreasonableness to conclude that she would straighten up her desk beforeending her life ive heard of people who washed their laundry beforekilling themselves      going through the desk drawers i find her hot news folder—a slimred leather envelope purse hailey had admired the one i have that i keepmy current work in as a surprise going away gift i gave her one      theres very little in it some notes about a society wedding a minorincident at sea between a british freighter and german warship the failureof a mediumsize london bank not the sort of news interesting toamericans that she was expected to dig up i recognized the articles asfillers that reporters on deadlines keep to fill in on those days when all thegood stories are hiding from you      she must have been so depressed she wasnt working on anything ofimportance in the days before her death      as i pick up a pencil to tap the eraser against my teeth an old habit ofmine i notice the eraser is blackened its been burnt      why would an eraser head be burnt      i look under the desk for a wastepaper basket voilà someone hadburned paper in the metal basket and stirred the ashes with the pencil      another why pops into my head why would hailey do thisreporting isnt that competitive what was so important to hailey that shenot only had to burn it but destroy it completely      or … did the man who ruined haileys life pay a visit to the office todestroy evidence of their relationship or her murder      here i go again am i barking up the wrong tree or have i discoveredsomething my problem is i dont want to face what i have been told iwant to find another truth      its time to speak to the gatekeeper                                      9my instinct about the young man at the gate is that he is or was infatuatedwith hailey the pale thin young man with goldrimmed glasses strikes meas rather shy and perhaps even a little timid hailey had a more outgoingpersonality i cant see them as a match     exuberant excited by life and even rather adventurous hailey wasmore likely to fall into a swoon over a knight in shining armor than a mildmannered clerk but that doesnt mean they hadnt become friends or thathe didnt quietly observe hailey and know more about her than she evensuspected     did you find everything satisfactory he asks as i come out the gateand he rises to speak to me     somewhat mr…     james anderson please call me james     james do you know what trolley i can take to haileysboardinghouse from here with the rain if its much the same as in newyork there is little possibility of me catching a taxi i didnt give him theaddress because i am curious as to whether he knows where she lived     youre so right he chuckles and his face brightens up hailey and iused to laugh about how the cabs mysteriously disappeared off the streetsthe minute it just starts to sprinkle     you shared taxis     no neither of us could afford getting to and from in a hansom werode the same trolley number eightyseven her boardinghouse is just acouple of blocks from mine and the trolley stopped in between go to yourleft when you leave the building the trolley stop is three blocks up thestreet i see you are already outfitted with an umbrella a must in london     i hold up the black umbrella that was in the basket i requisitioned theone from our office james i need to know the stories hailey was workingon but i found very little in her office did she by chance mention anythingto you     no she wouldnt have spoken openly not with them being able tohear a jerk of his head tells me that them are the reporters in thenewsroom     she never mentioned anything at all     no im sorry     do you know who she might have been dating     he shook his head no idea i suspected she was seeing someonebecause she was so happy and excited     she spoke about the person     no not really it wasnt anything she said but how she acted andthere were the flowers     flowers she received flowers from a man     yes i dont know who sent them but i can tell you the man waswealthy     how do you know this     the flowers were exotic not your normal roses or daises     any chance you remember the name of the florist     that wont do you any good     excuse me why would you say that     instead of responding he instantly blushes and looks down at hisshoes     i gently touch his arm you were fond of hailey werent you     ya—yes he stammers     you wanted to make sure no one would take advantage of her so youasked the deliveryman who had sent the flowers     he nods yes but he didnt know a messenger always came withinstructions and payment     i bit my lip as i think about that it sounds very much like the actionsof a married man     miss bly did—did hailey ever mention me in her letters to you     yes she did i lie she was very fond of you     i was very fond of her too     i appreciate your help james if you remember anything pleasecontact me i will be at the langham hotel for the next few days     i turn to leave and stop as he says i dont believe it     believe what     that she killed herself     i take a sharp intake of breath trying not to expose my feelings whydont you believe it people kill themselves every day     arent people supposed to get depressed over a period of time slowlygetting worse and then finally ending it     i almost blurt out not if theyre pregnant but hold my tonguebecause i dont want to damage his memory of hailey instead i ask whatdo you mean     she wasnt depressed she was excited … even secretive     about what     dont know but she acted like any of these reporters act when theythink they have a big scoop they go around like theyre holding theirbreath theyre dying to tell someone but dont dare even give a hint     when did you last see hailey     two days before the police say she killed herself     two days were there other times when she didnt come to the officefor days at a time     not that i recall     and she didnt appear depressed     no im telling you she was secretive     as if she was onto a big story     yes id swear by it it was like she wanted to blurt something out butcouldnt he gave me a long hard look what do you think miss blywhy did she do it why did she throw herself into the river and—     everyone is different is all i can manage before i flee out the door                                    10never have my feet moved so fast to remove myself from a building and ikeep walking fast once i hit the street—very fast im not hurryingsomewhere but fleeing the suspicions of the lovestricken james      holy mackerel and i thought my paranoia runs rampant      i hadnt seen hailey during the days leading up to her death but jameshad and his impression of haileys mood—that clamming up by a reporteron a hot lead but dying to share—is exactly how i act and exactly how iwould expect hailey to have conducted herself\\t      face it i tell myself you just dont think hailey killed herself andjames inflamed your suspicions      what if haileys excitement wasnt about a scoop what if herexcitement was about the fact that she had found out she was pregnantand the man she believed loved her lied and told her he would marry herand killed her instead      nonsense but i dont know my paranoia gone wild maybe butjames had added not just his own impressions and feelings about haileybut a couple of curious facts hailey had not been around the office for twodays before she killed herself and the last time he saw her she had been inan elated mood      i chew on the information because it is so inconsistent with the way ilike james imagine the character of a suicidal person to be while it is agiven that her mood could have changed radically over a period of fortyeight hours the state of her office adds another puzzling dimension theoffice had been cleaned out that is the only way i can characterize it in myown thoughts cleaned out as if someone was not planning to return to it      while some people might be tidy about their possessions even whentheir head is full of killing themselves james told me that hailey had beenin a very high mood the last time he saw her two days before she died      if that were the case then hailey would have cleaned out the office ata time when she appeared to a coworker as having a pleasant—even elated—disposition      i shake my head the contradictions are rattling my brain if it isntlikely she would have cleaned out the office when she was in a good moodthen someone else came afterward and did it my prime candidate for themysterious someone would be the lover fearing scandal      as far as getting access to the building without james noting him thatcould have been accomplished any number of ways in fact i should haveasked him if any strangers had been inside the building or if anyone elsehad obtained access to haileys office besides myself      the brown study im in about hailey almost makes me miss the trolleyjames told me to take its crowded and im pushed into a woman next tome as the rail car sets off with a jerk she pushes back and then nudges me      look at that foolish man      a man with a bowler hat is running frantically to catch the trolley hegrabs a handrail at the rear corner of the car and nearly slips under as heloses his footing but hangs on and pulls himself up to get footing on thestep      hes going to get himself killed one day i saw it once with my owneyes a man tried to do the same thing running after the trolley andjumping on while its moving only he wasnt as lucky raining like todaythe poles were slippery he lost hold and he went under it was awful hewas crushed to death by the wheels she shakes her head mark mywords one day hell end up with the same fate      shes right he had been foolish i just hope that whatever his hurry isits worth risking his life for                                     11four other passengers get off at my stop including the man in the bowlerhat who had defied death to get aboard he had ignored the verbal jabs ofother passengers about his feat and seems a surly type     even though the rain has basically stopped the air still feels wet as ifit has soaked into my clothing with haileys boardinghouse a long blockup the street im glad i took the umbrella     the neighborhood of row houses reminds me of the large brownstonesin manhattan except these are older and were more presentable decadespast a bit drab and blackened by the coal soot that is the bane of modernliving most of the houses need tender loving care many have been turnedinto boarding homes     im puzzling over what to say to haileys landlady and mentally kickmyself for not getting a note from the inspector giving me permission toexamine her room and dispose of her effects     i was so distraught over haileys suicide note it slipped my mindsaying im a coworker probably wouldnt be the best approach     im still wondering what to say when the door is answered by a youngmaid     im hailey mcguires sister from america i tell her the lie flowsnaturally off my tongue i did think of her as a sister ive come to collectsome of her belongings would you kindly take me to her room     this is not a complete lie i do need to select clothing for haileysfuneral but i also want to go through her things and see if i can unravel thepuzzle of her last days     she appears hesitant and i fear my bluff isnt going to work     mrs franklin isnt here right now     i promised the funeral director i would get clothes for him today     oh im sorry shell be back shortly     ill wait for her as soon as i am in the foyer i add in haileysroom if you dont mind      i find the foyer a surprise it is a little more pleasant than i imaginednothing fancy just well kept though still boardinghouse impersonal alarge grandfather clock is to the left of the stairway to the second floor aparlor is off to the right and the dining room to the far left its much thesame as the boardinghouses id lived in before i could afford an apartmentall were a little drab and lacking in the warmth a personal touch brings asimple vase of flowers and brighter furnishings would give the place a morecheerful and homey look      as we go up the stairs i ask the maid did you and hailey chatmuch      were not allowed to mingle with the residents she gives me a lookyour sister was a very nice person she always said hello to me and wouldask me how my day was she didnt treat me as a servant      yes thats hailey      i will need to stay with you she says as she fumbles with a skeletonkey as she opens haileys door mrs franklin has very strict rules      please … i need a few moments alone i hate putting her in a spotbut i cant have her watching as i make a thorough search of the room tellmrs franklin that i insisted ill leave the door open      i suppose its all right you being her sister and all ill be just downthe hallway cleaning      haileys room is small she has a window that looks out onto a gardenarea that has suffered the blistering of winterkill but i can see how it mustbe pretty in the spring and summer months hailey was lucky to have awindow it makes the room feel more open      she would have been able to look out when she was relaxing on herbed because the bed is on the wall opposite the window under the windowis a small desk with a round forest green cloth stool to sit on to the left ofthe bed is an armoire that holds clothes and other personal belongings tothe right of the bed and across from the armoire is a washstand with amirror and a little vanity table that has a lipstick blush comb—all laid outas if she is coming back      the washstand has a small white porcelain basin on the floorunderneath are two bowls one has cat food and the other water no cat isaround i hope they found a good home for it      i sit on her bed and look through her nightstand in the drawer is alittle notepad that has a rubber band around it holding a pencil tight aquick peek tells me its her expense accounting for rent food and the likethere are no notations for several days before her death but i want toexamine it more at length so i shove it in my purse and continue goingthrough her dresser there is nothing out of the ordinary whatever storiesshe had been working on she apparently hadnt brought them home yetshe would have been working on a number of them at any one time      why cant i find any notes and clippings she was working on shecabled articles every day to new york most often not original stories shewrote but just a rehash of news she found in london papers that she feltwould interest new york readers yet nothing is at her office or in herroom which begs a question why would she—or someone else—get ridof them      either hailey was being overly tidy before she killed herself—and shewas not a slave to being orderly with her work materials—or someone hadcleaned out everything to ensure that nothing would be found      i do find a pretty brooch that i know she liked and stick it in my pocketas a memento      where hailey i look around the room talking maybe haileysghost is lingering about where did you hide the name of the man youwere involved with      it has to be someplace very secretive but where i peek under hermattress under the bed … nothing i rummage through her armoire …nothing i shove a bunch of hangers over to one side and one drops when ithits the bottom of the armoire it makes a dull thud sound      kneeling down i take out shoes and a hatbox and tap the wood itsounds hollow in the far left inside corner is a tiny hole barely enough toput my finger in i lift off the false bottom and inside the recessed area is abook—a diary      jackpot i go straight to the very last entry she has a cryptic noteim going on a journey further in spirit than my feet will carry me      oh no… barely comes from me as i sink to the floor anyonereading this would interpret it as an admission to suicide there is nothingabout bad love or being pregnant … nothing maybe in her previousentries …       she told me shes her sister…       i jump up almost losing my balance the maids voice is pleadingwith someone       you know the rules       that has to be the landlady her voice reeks with authority       i slip the diary into the pocket of my coat       when the queen of hearts walks in im hanging up a blouse notlooking happy that shes out of the rabbit hole       what are you doing in here       without waiting for an answer she grabs the blouse from my hand as ifi had snatched the crown jewels       you might fool my foolish maid but i will tell you the same thing isaid when her socalled brother came nothing goes out til i confirm it withthe police       her brother im baffled by her proclamation about a brother but itdoesnt last long the nasty woman reminds me of nurse grupe who iencountered during my ten days in a madhouse on blackwells island and ihated that woman if she thinks shes going to bully me shes got anotherthing coming she—we dont have a brother       i know she didnt have any family       im her adopted sister and her supervisor at the newspaper we workfor im nellie bly       i dont care if youre the queen of sheba nothing is leaving thisroom im owed rent and this stuff will be sold to cover it as soon as thepolice are finished with their investigation and it wont be enough to coverit let me tell you       ah … i see her heart is beating with that eternal rhythm that hasdriven human beings since the dawn of time—greed       how much is owed my publisher will make good the full amount ofrent i glance around and of course other than the clothes i will need tohave sent over to the funeral home you can dispose of the rest of the itemsas you wish       the womans face softens to the texture of paving stones welltheres many a charity in need i always say       i am sure that in her case charity begins and stays at home       tell me about this man who claimed to be her brother      he was british he told me that they were estranged and i told him allthe more reason he couldnt look through her stuff estranged in my booksmeans you are no longer family      what did he look like      i dont know i wasnt planning to draw his picture he was mediumbuilt long dark hair blue eyes dont really remember anything else norcare as i told you makes no difference who comes and who says whatnothing goes out until i get me rent im tired of people coming in here likeit was a public place first that abberline copper then the one yesterday thatmade a fine mess going through everything now you doing only the lordknows what nothing leaves here til i get me money      very good policy i only left the officer in charge of the investigationinspector abberline a short time ago i have one other question what washaileys mood in those last few days before she died      how would i know i leave my boarders to themselves as long asthey pay their rent on time have no shenanigans in their rooms and be herebefore i lock the doors at night i dont care what their moods are or whatthey do i keep my nose out of their lives      shes lying of course the woman probably spies on her boarders      did she talk to you or any of the other boarders about a particularstory she was working on      no now—      miss… the voice comes from the maid      maggie go attend to your chores      the maid quickly disappears down the hallway      mrs franklin turns back to me and points at the open door and untili see payment you can leave too      ill arrange payment and be back to select the clothing      what a witch—to put it politely—but i know i have gone as far as ican get with her so i leave besides the diary is burning a hole in mythoughts and i need to get somewhere to read it what a find—if a youngwoman is going to confess her life and loves anywhere it will be in hersecret journal      as i step out the front door of the house and start down the stairs ihear miss miss—      the maid comes out the front door behind me and hurries downlooking nervously back at it      you wanted to know about haileys mood she was happy notdepressed and excited we did talk sometimes she told me shed met theperfect man thats why i was so surprised when the police came and foundher note      did she tell you who the man was      no she couldnt      why not      she said she couldnt because he was very important and well knownwith the rich and powerful she said him and her needed time to figurethings out before making their romance public      when did she tell you this      three days before she took her life she came home late and isneaked her in i couldnt help notice she was wearing a beautiful ring iasked who gave it to her and she told me it was a gift from the man sheloved and that i mustnt tell anyone about it it was a secret she also saidshe was going to be moving out that this man was going to take care ofeverything she was so happy      what did the ring look like      it was a ruby surrounded by diamonds … very expensive      she didnt have a ring like that at the morgue if she had it on when herbody was recovered the morgue attendant or someone earlier took it didshe talk to you about any of the stories she was working on      yes yes… she looks back at the front door      its okay shes probably still in haileys room adding up how muchshe can sell everything for      maggie puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh you knowmrs franklin for sure you do about a week before she done herself inmiss mcguire said she was working on a story that would give her … ohwhat was the word … recognition she was so excited but i have no ideawhat it was about im sorry i cant be more help she was always sosecretive about the news stories she worked on but i think i knowsomething maggie uses a confidential tone and glances back again to seeif the boogey woman has reared her ugly head      three or four days before she died i was cleaning her room and ihappened upon an article on her bed stand that she had scribbled on ofcourse i never looked closely at it knowing how she was about keepingthings a secret      of course not what was the article about      a doctor      do you remember the doctors name      no      what about the doctor      some woman lady somebody had died      he killed her      no … i dont know i have to go back in      wait please think do you remember anything about the doctor      she bit her lip hes … hes a health doctor he makes peoplehealthier he was treating the woman with something that wasnt realmedicine and she died ive gotta go      here      i take her hand and put the brooch in it her jaw drops      this is expensive … i cant…      yes now go run before mrs franklin catches you      i too hurry away taking a good deep breath relieved to have gottenaway from that terrible woman i would not have been so kind and gentle toher if i didnt know that she would have taken my tongue lashing out on herpoor servant girl      i take the diary out of my pocket and stick it in my purse once i find acafé i will stop and read the diary over tea and biscuits      my heart pounds … i have haileys diary now i will be able to getanswers      the restraint of not plopping myself down and reading her diary isdriving me nuts but i cant chance the evil queen of hearts watching mefrom an upper floor window to see if i had stolen anything      which i had of course                                    12archer watches from a hundred feet away as nellie bly comes out of theboardinghouse he picks up his step to stay close enough behind her tomake a quick move if he has to he doesnt want to bring attention tohimself or risk getting his legs chopped off again if she boards a trolley      he gets a jolt as the bly woman pulls a red book out of her pocket andslips it into her purse without looking at it      the diary      it had to be the diary it had that look and color but the furtive wayshe slipped it into her purse was the tipoff that makes him certain shehadnt gotten the book with the landladys permission      how did she get her hands on it      he had bluffed his way into the mcguire womans room yesterday byshowing his old police badge once inside he did a thorough search of theroom he knew from over a dozen years as a copper that women are muchmore clever than men when it comes to hiding evidence but leave it up to awoman to find another womans hiding place      he should have torn the place completely apart even without thepolice badge the old bitch that runs the boardinghouse would have sold himanything he had wanted from the room for a quid      the bly woman turns the opposite direction from the trolley stop asshe comes up to the corner      shes anxious to take a peek in the book going for hot tea and a warmplace to read it good that means she hadnt had time to read it and shewouldnt get her nose between the pages either not on his watch he hasto get it before she reads it that was made very clear to him if he wants toget paid very well      getting this job had been a fluke saving him from the final slip intothe gutter that hed been sliding toward since he had been dismissed fromthe force for taking bribes from a bookmaker to supplement that lousysalary they pay junior detectives      it wasnt his fault he had had a wife who liked luxuries thats howhe kept getting in deeper first for what she wanted to wear and eat and thenshe even demanded he wore expensive suits i aint being seen with a mandressed like a street cop is what she told him so he did the only thing hecould he went on the take looked the other way for a tidy sum from thebookmaker who handled bets on the races and sports as his wifesdemands got bigger and his tastes got more refined he started shakingdown some of the criminals hed collared when one of them tried to turnthe tables by blackmailing he had beaten the man half to death his onlyregret was that he hadnt completed the other half of the beating because thebastard was able to tell a doctor who hed been smacked by and why      if only he had kept his temper down and dumped his wife long agobut he fell hard for her beauty and that she was an actress he neverunderstood why she married him nor did anyone else he was big andburly with a face that had been bashed into too many times over fights hestarted while she was delicate like a china doll she had manners he hadnone      he knew the other coppers were jealous of his gorgeous wife andexpensive habits they constantly were asking him how he did it—withevery one of the bastards knowing and not a few of them also on the take      the money he always had jangling in his pockets aside he knew hehad also made enemies on the force because of his temper his way ofsolving anything right or wrong was to punch hard talking didnt get youanywhere at least thats what he learned from his dad who used his fistsmore than once on archer until archer got big enough to give titfortat      in his mind no one on the force cared that he was taking bribesbecause others were on the take too they just remembered how manytimes he pushed his way in to get what he wanted ratting him out was theirway of getting even      now hes answering to a wealthy aristocrat whos a lot more corruptthan him no one made millions of quid in business without doing thingsunder the table that would make a bank robber look like a saint      he had come into contact with the rich man when he was still on theforce soon after he was promoted to junior detective the mans teenageson was being investigated for beating another boy severely over a girl thefather slipped archer some money and the case got dumped     now the man has another problem a problem the police couldnthandle youll be my consulting detective is what he told archer     archer didnt care about his title all he cared about was the money hewas sick and tired of being poor and he wanted revenge the kind hed getwhen he looked up his exwife and made her green with envy with hispockets full of money hell shove money in her face then to really makeher mad hell lavish it on another actress she knows hes not worriedabout who hell get all actresses are sluts and will do anything for moneyshe did     this book the american woman found in the dead girls room will behis ticket back to the good life he knows something valuable is in itinformation that will make him a wealthy man and if that aristocratic pigwho hired him thinks he is just going to simply turn it over to him for a fewlousy quid—hes in for a big surprise     but first he has to get it from the woman     being the man he is asking her for it politely isnt in the cards                                    13blueeyed brother i mulled over what haileys landlady told me with abritish accent no less now who in the devil is he the elusive lover whyhe would want access to haileys room is the one thing about him imcertain about he wants the diary because there is something in it that willexpose him as her lover and i have the damning evidence      wha— pops out of my mouth as a man comes up from behind megrabs my purse and takes off like a bat out of hell      help help he has my purse i yell at the top of my lungs as i givechase there is no one else in sight on this gray wet day      i only get a glance of him but im positive its the man who made themad dash to get on the trolley near haileys office and got off with me ather boardinghouse      his head goes down and i get the impression hes opening my purse itry to increase my speed but my long dress ridiculous petticoats and bulkyhightopped heeled shoes that encase a woman work against me sprinting      a woman comes out of a food store and the man concentrating on thecontents of my purse runs right into her her grocery bag flies out of herhand exploding as it hits the ground the man stumbles to stay on his feet      my purse flies into the air as he throws it over his head back at me asthe woman he nearly bowled over yells a curse at him      quickly grabbing my purse off the ground i determine that my coinpurse with my gold coins and folded money are inside but something evenmore important is missing haileys diary      whats happened the woman asks me that thief get yourmoney      no not my money      thank god you all right      yes and you      oh im fine cant say the same for me groceries      as we gather up her food the grocer comes out of the store and theychatter about how unsafe the streets are for honest people and the policedo nothing the grocer says      even though i am hearing everything they say none of it penetrates thefog in my brain my god—the diary was stolen taken from me in broaddaylight by a man who must have been following me from haileys office      you sure youre all right the woman asks me again you look likeyouve seen the devil      yes … im okay im just amazed at how devious people are andwhat terrible things rational human beings are capable of      did you hit your head dear      the murky stuff in my head is still there as i am carried away in ahansom cab to my hotel      shocked down to my socks i admit and angry is the lover sodesperate about being exposed that he is resorting to criminal acts itsobvious to me that this is the case and i cant help wondering if there ismore to it than just the mans identity is he also trying to cover up somecomplicity in haileys death did she get that bump on her head before shewent into the water      i dont know whether its a lover trying to avoid scandal or onecovering up murder but i realize that i have been looking for a reason tofind hailey hadnt killed herself almost from the time i got the news in newyork now that i know something is amiss i am confronted with both adilemma and a challenge what can i do about it      im alone in a foreign country thousands of miles from the resourcesand contacts that i can employ whenever i do an investigation and imunder a time pressure the paper expects me to stay only a few days to layhailey to rest and clear up her desk as mr cockerill instructed me afterthat they expected me back beating the bushes for stories      which is another quandary im in do i want to return to the world      their cavalier treatment of me since my return from my trip around theworld has me questioning if i want to continue working for the newspapermr pulitzer and the editorinchief never even said so much as thank youor offered a salary increase or any other reasonable compensation a manwould have received for a similar accomplishment bottom line i did notreceive one cent and my salary has been a very low one      after my insane asylum exposé which i know did not garner a fractionof the publicity and increase in ratings that my trip around the world did ireceived a generous bonus check i have yet to receive one      and not to sound petty but the only thank you i received from mrpulitzer was a cabled congratulation with a note begging me to accept a giftfrom india another item i have yet to receive such treatment would neverhave been given to a man      if i hadnt written around the world in 72 days4 i would be inhorrible financial straights for i am not just taking care of myself i amtaking care of my mother brothers and sister      to make matters worse shortly after i returned my favorite bothercharles died—inflammation of the bowel he was only twentyeight fiveyears older than me5 and that worries me ive been having health issuesmyself and the doctor keeps telling me i need a vacation i thought my triparound the world would be one but instead it was very stressful6 but imustnt think of that for now i have more pressing issues at hand i musthelp provide for his widow sarah and their two small children charles andgertrude after our father died charles and i made a pact always to takecare of each other i will not let him down      so when a book publisher nl munro offered me an incredible threeyear contract to write dimenovel fiction7 in a series of installments for hisweekly new york family story paper—ten thousand dollars for the firstyear and fifteen thousand for each of the next two years8—i couldnt refusewhile this is more than what mr pulitzer will ever offer me reporting thenews is oxygen to my soul and i dont know if im ready to give it up but ido know that healthwise i cant write the books and remain a reporter      my poor head wants to explode but i must focus back on the issue athand—my attacker      the first question is who was the man that attacked me in broaddaylight on a public street hired help i am sure nor did he appear to meto be someone that hailey would have become romantically entangled with      he looked street tough the sort of man youd find in a lowerclass barand hire to do dirty work the kind that the police investigate      i hadnt paid much attention to him when he came aboard the trolleybut reflecting now my impression of him is that while he wore a businesssuit it needed cleaning and some attention from a hot iron indicating to methat he probably isnt married and that he might be down on the heels froma higher position in life than the one he now held      he is hardly the important personage that hailey had boasted about toboth the maid and james the gatekeeper definitely just hired help paid toget the diary and whatever else the lover wanted the covers pulled over butwhat is in the diary that would make haileys lover take the risk of havinghis thug commit a street crime that could send both him and the street toughto prison      the lovers identity or a more serious crime—the murder of hailey      that diary speaks from the grave words that might not be directevidence of murder but might point to the man who made her pregnant andraise questions that would make the police reconsider a simple verdict ofsuicide      then there is the other question eating away at my mind how does thebig story hailey was working on fit in she mentioned doing a major storyto both james and the maid yet i found nothing about it in her room andfound at her office only the red file with just filler stories more importantthan the stories i didnt find were the ashes left behind the onlyexplanation for the burning that my head will accept is that someonepossibly the mugger who attacked me went into her office and burned allevidence of the story      there has to be a connection between the story and the man hailey hadbecome infatuated with that all references to the story were destroyedbecause they led back to the man who wanted his identity kept secret seemsa reasonable conclusion to me but could the two situations be completelyalien to each other a coincidence no way will i accept that the diaryand the news story hailey was working on are linked to haileys lover andher lover obviously has no scruples when it comes to relying on violence toget what he wants i might not have fared as well today if id met that thugin a dark alley      but for the life of me i cant imagine how the lover and the news storycould be linked hailey imitated me in carving out a career in reportingand that meant that inevitably any story that hailey would go overboardabout would involve crime political dirty dealing or other scandalousmatters the world is not a scandal sheet by any means but it did notbecome the circulation champ by being anything but a bareknuckle streetfighter when it comes to the news      my gut tells me i cant go to abberline until i have more evidence hehas the suicide note and i cant tell him what is in the diary as for themugger hell point out that purse snatchings are common instincts in anycity anywhere—and it so happens that london is the most populous city inthe entire world i can almost hear him telling me exactly how many pursesnatchings occur every day in the city—and my retort being of course howmany of them discarded the money in a purse and ran off with a youngwomans diary      his rebuttal will be that the thief got confused and simply startingthrowing things and hed want to know if i continued after the thief to seeif he had soon discarded the diary i didnt and my failure to do so would bethe inspectors coup de grace in the discussion      no a simple purse snatching isnt going to impress him or win himover to my side not without something solid nor will the feelings of amaid and an office clerk that hailey wasnt suicidal since neither was anintimate of haileys      until i have an explanation for the suicide note i cant go to theinspector at the moment the only explanation that sits well with me is thatshe was coerced into writing it under duress unfortunately i have no proofexcept the hairs standing up on the back of my neck and someone muggingme      where to start is not a difficult question for me like hailey i am areporter and know the beat she was working on a story about a medicalscandal involving a health doctor and a highsociety woman so i will startthere and see where it leads me      hopefully the news story and the man in her life who betrayed andprobably murdered her will intersect      i could drop by a newspaper office and ask reporters about recentstories featuring a health doctor and a dead noblewoman but i already havean inside source for london high society and its rumors innuendos andscandals—basically an artery to all that goes on in london society      drop me at the nearest telegraph office i tell the cabbie through thehansom cabs roof door     it is time to contact an old friend one who once fought killers with meand who is not only a worldchampion purveyor of gossip but perhaps alsothe most common subject of gossip in the city and a shameless instigator ofthe most outrageous titillating and racy scandals on the planetyou will find me at the langham under the name of count von kramm     —the king of bohemia from a scandal in bohemia by sir arthur conan                                                                    doyle                                      14im meeting mr ernest i tell the maître d at the dining room in thelangham hotel the grande dame of hotels in the world and the epitome ofelite chic      im escorted to a table to bide my time while i wait for mr ernestwho is my friend and sometime partner in crime—detection of course—oscar wilde      oscars reply to my telegraph had advised me cryptically that hewould present himself incognito at the restaurant thus the mr ernest bitand would offer explanations that must be kept under the rose it took mea moment to realize that under the rose was an idiom for secrecy datingback to ancient times      as the wit and scandalous rascal of london society both because ofhis sharp tongue and refusal to limit his sexual activities to those dictated byrespectable people and straitlaced religious organizations oscars need tohide out could have arisen from any number of things he said—or did      the fact we were meeting in the most fashionable and exquisite hoteldining room in london at a time when oscar is incognito is merely partof the charm of a man who upon his arrival in america to begin hisspeaking tour advised a customs officer that he had nothing to declare buthis genius      i admit i had been taken in by oscars secrecyladen message butwhen my cab dropped me off where the entrance to the hotel is completelylit with electric lights and the doorman who is waiting to help me down andescort me in is dressed as modestly as the admiral of the royal fleet idecided oscar may be more melodramatic than in danger      my poor stomach grumbles and i mutter where are you oscar as iawait his presence his response instructed me to meet him at tenthirty afashionable time for dinner after plays are over i check my fathers pocketwatch hes five minutes late and there is nothing fashionable about myhealthy appetite      ive never gotten used to chic latenight eating not even after severalyears in new york and im hungry enough to nibble on the wood table inmy hometown of cochran mills pennsylvania population exactly 534 igrew up having dinner at six sharp not hours after the sun has gone down      i almost feel like getting up and going back to roam again in theencased garden atrium its really lovely and so unexpected in downtowngray foggy london they took the inner courtyard and covered it with aniron and glass roof so it can be enjoyed yearround scattered among theflowers and trees are wroughtiron tables and cushioned chairs and benchesso one can sit and gaze at the stars as they sip wine i imagine it must bebeautiful to sit and watch snowflakes fall it would be like being in one ofthose glass balls my mother has that you shake and watch the snow fall onthe animals in a forest      ive traveled the world and seen many gorgeous hotels but never havei experienced a place as elegant as the langham throughout the publicareas they have intricately laid mosaic flooring decorated in white goldand scarlet selectively hanging on walls covered with handprintedwallpaper are moorish murals and silk hangings—each having a story oftheir own to tell white marble pillars that give one the feeling of purewealth are standing guard all about      coming through the grand entrance hanging on the hallway wallleading into the dining area is a persian tapestry carpet that must have cost akings ransom      the dining room is enormous and simply dazzling their wallpaper isa light creamy beige adorned with little golden angels each holding a blackbow and arrow—some shooting arrows and some sitting on fluffy whiteclouds and something ive rarely seen electric chandeliers—thousands ofcrystals of all shapes and sizes lit with lightbulbs there are over a dozen ofthese brilliant lighting fixtures hanging from the fourteenfoot ceiling whichis a highly polished pinkish italian veneziano plaster—or as the italians saythe womens stucco because it burnishes to an even gloss with very littleeffort white marble pillars are scattered among the tables one wall isfloortoceiling glass that overlooks the encased garden all this creates asumptuous atmosphere perfect for eating … which im dying to do      when the maître d took me to my table i paused for a moment andstared at a large stone fireplace with roaring flames on the opposite wallfrom the glass wall—the wood is not being burned a gas fireplace hetells me with ceramic logs      amazing what will they think of next      our table sits right in the center of the room if oscar wantsanonymity this is definitely not going to please him however if i take intoconsideration a pillar which is right by our table oscar might have a littleprivacy from the curious if he is truly planning to appear in some sort ofdisguise      each table is set with floral china sitting on top of silver charger platessterling silverware crystal water and wine glasses a small vase of flowersand a candle in a decorative etched glass candleholder in the center of thetable some settings like mine have a crystal wine holder that looks like aduck      after seeing what other diners are wearing im not happy being in thecenter of the room and find myself leaning toward the pillar to hide thecouture is formal men are in white tie the women in evening gowns somesleeveless with long gloves most with feathered hats and almost everywoman has either a pearl necklace dazzling diamonds—or both      not many months ago i completed a seventytwoday trip around theworld with only one change of clothes that i carried in a small valise yetmanaged to attend shipboard dinner parties without shame i came tolondon with the same valise and the same one change of clothes and thesame lack of embarrassment i work hard and travel fast and light andrefuse to load myself down with trunks in order to look fashionable      if the other women in the world believe they are seeing an uglyduckling crossing the room they are probably right but id like to tell eachof them that i earn my own duck food      i hear a stir and murmuring among the diners and look toward thedoor      there he is in all his glory pausing as he enters i shake my head andsigh incognito      oscar is wearing a green velvet suit with wide lapels a white silk shirtwith a lord byron collar and an oversized red tie that is loosely tied and aswide as a scarf his cape is purple and reaches nearly down to the heels ofhis brilliantly polished black patent leather shoes his hat is black andwould have gone nicely on the head of one of the three musketeers     besides the clothing that would have raised eyebrows at a showing ofalices adventures in wonderland much less at a posh restauranthotel inthe heart of londons west end everything about oscar is big—sixfootthree soft and flabby with a low mezzo voice that people concentrated tohear yet reaches across a room his mind is big too encyclopedic histongue a guillotine that cuts through hypocrisy and affronts with a razoredged blade     he excitedly waves his hand as he weaves around a sea of tablescoming toward me with as much subtlety as shermans march on atlanta—no make that moses crossing the red sea oscar is carrying a white poochdressed much the same way he is                              oscar wildei think that god in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability                                                                       —oscar wilde                                      15nellie     the pooch barks its a small white poodle wearing a duplicate hat anda purple cape that matches oscars if oscars flamboyant entrance had notalready captured every eye in the room the barking of the provocativelydressed dog for sure brought stares from everyone     i should have known that its simply not in oscars makeup to isolatehimself from the world lost on a desert island hed recruit the monkeysand the fish as a social circle     there is no rose big enough for him to hide himself or his secretsunder obviously everyones eyes are upon him which is understandablesince this man is like no other on the entire planet oscar wilde is one of akind—and god broke the mold after he created the man     and i wouldnt change a hair on his head     i get up to hug him oh oscar ive missed you     he gives me this huge smile and then immediately puts his hands tohis mouth to cover his bad teeth as he giggles ive so missed you toonelliegirl     as we hug one more time before sitting down the doggie hes carryinggets squished between us again     oh you poor thing … whats your name as i pet the little fellowhe paws me and licks my fingers oscar he isnt wearing purple nailpolish     of course it must match his cape nellie meet lord dudley     lord dudley … okay i suppose that fits     isnt this place magnificent look at all its beauty oscar surveysthe place as if hes admiring his kingdom hes always been attracted tobeauty this place is a tour de force there is no other like it in the world     i know its the first to have hydraulically powered lifts airconditioning and its own steampumped artesian well the hotel boredthree hundred and sixtyfive feet below the basement floor into the chalkbasin and with the help of two fourteenhorsepower pumps they are able topump twentyfive thousand gallons of water into iron tanks in the cupolatower that distributes hot and cold running water to every bedroom thatmy dear oscar is truly amazing      yes it is how did you…      i love surprising oscar with my knowledge since he believes us pooramericans are so ignorant so i continue you must know that sir jameslangham built a mansion on this site in 1820 subsequently namedlangham place because its ninetyfive feet above the thames high watermark on fine gravel soil making it healthier than the peat bogs in belgravianearer the thames in fact this area is not only regarded as the healthiest inlondon but has a much lower death rate than any other of the citysdistricts      poor oscar just sits looking at me confounded i almost break downand tell him when i was waiting for him i overheard a gentleman explainingin detail to his dinner companions from italy about the place      nellie you never cease to amaze me      why thank you what also impresses me is they have telephones areal rarity anywhere a post office two libraries that have uptodatenewspapers and journals from around the world public lavatories a railwayticketing and shipping office all under one roof and their employees arequalified to converse in every language from pure yankee to high dutch iwonder if this is the way all hotels will be one day      maybe but they will never have the beauty like this place onceagain oscar pauses sweeping the room with his eyes soaking in all itsexquisiteness art which comes in all forms—paintings sculpturespeople décor—has one purpose to display beauty and this place does itmagnificently i believe we are nothing but gods canvas and its amazingwhat some of us do with it look at the elderly ladies here… he pauses fora moment and nods at one and then another      they all have gigantic tiaras and parrot noses      oscar but i couldnt help laughing hes right      thank god i wont end up looking like that truculent and redfacedold gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons did you know thatthe romantic novelist marie louise de la ramée or ouida as she liked tocall herself lived here for four years before she died what a marvelouseccentric one day she invited me to her room she was lying on her bedwearing only a sheer green silk sinister nightgown surrounded withmasses of purple flowers and candles she refused to have the black velvetcurtains drawn claimed the obtrusive daylight made it hard for her to thinkcouldnt help but love a lady who said she did all her best work in bed      oscar laughs with such delight i cant help but laugh myself      your first american to be a guest here was henry wadsworthlongfellow samuel langhorne clemens or better known to the public asmark twain stays here whenever he comes to london in fact my ownnovel the picture of dorian gray that will soon be out was negotiatedwith the publisher at this very table also present at that dinner was arthurconan doyle the writer of the sherlock holmes stories9 have you read hismystery stories      no not yet      well you must it will sharpen your detecting skills      congratulations on your book what is it about      the philosophy of beauty its about what one can choose to do withhis life and how he can either destroy it… oscar pauses for a moment asif his life is passing him by      as much as i hate silence especially awkward ones like these i keepquiet for his sake he is a dear soul who has to endure a lot of cruelty andcriticism from society yet somehow he manages to keep his humor andlove for life or more appropriately beauty i wish i was as strong as him      … or try to make it worthy i think it is a masterpiece one might sayits as lovely as a persian carpet and as unreal i must say the publisherwas a bit disappointed that he didnt get all the words he wanted its truewe had agreed on a manuscript of a hundred thousand words but after icompleted it i informed him that there were not a hundred thousandbeautiful words in the english language      and i imagine that you used all the beautiful ones in your book ishall rush and buy it the moment i see it out however oscar i must sayyou have me a bit confused      how so my dear      well with your story being published something youve alwayswanted which would make i believe life good in your telegram you saidthat you are incognito ducking trouble that sort of thing whats upim hiding in plain sight                                     16ah yes i should have thought of that why are you hiding in plain sight      that thing called love that the immortal dante said moved the sunand other stars unfortunately that which can move heavenly bodies cansometimes cause utter ruin and devastation among us mere mortals      which translates to…      as my miner friends in leadville would say i got caught with mypants down      i am afraid to ask if it had anything to do with buggery … because iam absolutely certain that it does i called poor oscar a sodomite the firsttime i met him thats before i got to know him and realized that his choiceof lovers is a private matter about which no one has the right to throw thefirst rock regardless of oscars distaste for the hypocrisy of our legalsystem that is heavily influenced by religion—the law still has severepenalties for men who mate with other men      i met a young ang—no not an angel an adonis whose appearance oneven a bright day is as if a more brilliant sun had suddenly risen in the skyand his looks … they are as if the gods had molded him from ivory androse leaves when i met him i had a strange feeling that fate had in storefor me exquisite joys and deep sorrows i was not let down unfortunatelynellie as our first ancestors learned in eden and i have discovered in thismatter behind every wondrous thing that exists there is something tragic ilike to think of it as there always being a snake in paradise      he loves someone else i say barely above a whisper hoping tobring down his own volume      oh no he booms its his damn father even in that raw colonyacross the pond youve heard of the marquis of queensbury      i believe we adopted the queensbury rules of boxing as a matter offact … gloves no punches in the clinch that sort of thing10      yes yes what a vulgar creature he is—the marquis he has a sonwho is the glorification of all that is beautiful and pure and the creatureembraces a sport in which men sweat and bleed and punch each other andthere is a tensecond count for a knockout      this goes on for ten minutes while oscar moans about the damage tohis soul how when one is in love one always begins by deceiving onesself and one always ends by deceiving others his lamenting is what theworld calls romance now because of all this tangled web his lover wovehe is in hiding because the queensbury marquis is out to practice some ofhis pugilistic talents on oscar for corrupting his son      somewhere between oscars breaths for air i manage to direct theconversation to hailey and he is an attentive audience as i start with newsof haileys suicide and end with being mugged for her diary i tell him thati suspect hailey was killed by a wealthy man to hide their affair      its karma he says when i am finished      karma      your consistent ability to stumble onto murder wherever you gothere is no other explanation for why people come to a violent end aroundyou      you think my karma killed hailey my features pucker ready fortears      oh my … no no no of course i didnt mean that he reaches overand pats my hand that was a bad choice of words on my part your karmacouldnt hurt a flea you care too much for people its not your fault thatthey die      youre saying i somehow had a hand in them being murdered myemotional state breaks      oscar quickly hands me his pink handkerchief before i flood dinnerwith my tears nellie you are taking this all the wrong way lord knowsyou try to prevent it and you do end up saving lives you saved mine      that stops my tears and i remember why i love this gentle giant nooscar … you saved my life and thats why i need your help again      youre in danger      no i dont think so but i cant let haileys killer get away withmurder or allow the people who knew her to think she took her own lifewhen she didnt that would be horrible      with my emotions back in control i tell oscar the news story about ahealth doctor and a society woman     ah yes the lady winsworth matter he says it was front pagenews until the next juicy story showed its head youve heard of drlacroix anthony lacroix no of course you havent youre a parochialcolonist and only interested in what happens on your side of the pondwhere should i start     at the beginning—with the doctor     our waiter sets down a crystal bowl of water on the floor for lorddudley oscar waits til he leaves and puts in on the table i cant let himout of my hands hell go socializing with the people     i believe you now back to the matter at hand     ah yes dr lacroix he has a mineral spa in bath near the ancientroman ruins he sells a substance that my miner friends in leadvillecolorado with whom i bellied up to the bar during my american tourwould call snake oil     we have quite a few salesmen of that type and not all in westernmining camps     aqua vitae oscar smacks his lips as if he can taste the name thewaters of life is a mixture made from the waters the doctor gets from themineral springs and his secret ingredients     whats his snake oil     ive heard its animal organs     what     most animals are much faster and more powerful than humansrejuvenation researchers seek the essence of animal organs that willrevitalize humans     yuck sounds disgusting people drink that stuff     they do if they want to stay young and beautiful or in the case ofmen still virile in old age and can afford it youth is not cheap or pretty onthe dark side of middle age     youre telling me this doctor mixes up a batch of animal organs andpeople pay to swig it down is this poison what killed the society lady     what killed the society lady is still an open question at the coronersoffice but the newspapers tried the doctor already and found him guiltysomething im quite familiar with anyway lady winsworth was anactress over forty maybe older she never told at least truthfully not onlybecause she married lord winsworth first baronet of barberry who if imcorrect is a few years younger than her though she looks much youngershe was also very vain it was imperative to her that she keep her youthfulbeauty being willing to try anything the fountain of youth rejuvenationthat dr lacroix sold fit the bill what she died of still puzzles the medicalexaminer from your experiences as a crime reporter you would know thecoroners doctors have very limited scientific resources      so who or what do you think killed her      i dont know but im sure that she was having an affair with drlacroix      thats a perfect motive for the husband to kill her but how do youknow she was having an affair with the doctor      he grins my study of human nature tells me a woman desperate toreassure herself that she wasnt growing old a younger man who may holdthe secret to her maintaining her beauty and who himself is consideredattractive by women in general      and is there a jealous husband in this scenario      yes the police are considering that angle especially since he had alover who is quite a bit younger than lady winsworth but i understandthat he was quite devoted to his wife despite his wanderings because shewas popular in social circles an area in which he fared badly he got luckyand made his pile in a south african gold mine but his father had been aliverpool dockworker it was the gold strike that got him the baronet titleafter he spread around some of his ample abundance to the queens favoritecauses but it was lady winsworths popularity that got him in with thecream of society he doesnt have the best of personalities hes not just abull in a china cabinet but a mean bull      now while theres been no charges against dr lacroix officiallyfiled and the case is still open i can tell you that lacroix has more to fearfrom lord winsworth than a police investigation winsworth is a rough andtumble guy the kind who knows you cant make an omelet withoutcracking eggs from what ive heard of the man dr lacroix would end upfloating facedown in the river if winsworth gets his hands on him      i winced at the image of a body facedown in the water this lacroixsounds like a charlatan      im not sure ive heard things from both sides of the aisle about himhe believes in rejuvenation taking years off of people turning back theclock a bit and he knows that most people will sell their soul for continualyouth its people like lady winsworth and the rest of the men and womenthat gave me the inspiration for creating dorian gray      oscar continues in his musical voice and with that graceful wave ofthe hand that is always so characteristic of him ive been expounding onmy beliefs about beauty for years the picture of dorian gray is just a …oh how would one say it … a culmination of my spoken thoughts put downin the written word my book discloses how our desire to keep young andbeautiful leads us to do things we never dreamed wed do and how in theend it destroys us well it makes no difference doctors—and witch doctors—have been practicing the art for thousands of years the ebers papyrus athreethousandyearold egyptian medical book talks about using the organsof animals to give humans the power and strength of beasts they used theorgans of bulls for example to improve human vitality      thats a lot of bull the pun is shameless on my part but i cant helpit      dont be so certain theres a very prominent frenchamericandoctor in paris named brownséquard hes renowned worldwide for hiswork with the human nervous system yet like lacroix he believes thatrejuvenation can be accomplished with human beings      oscar leans across the table for his next pronouncement and i know itwill be a bombshell      to revitalize his sex life he personally takes an extract he preparesfrom the testes of a bull      oh god i cant hold back a giggle      he claims it enhances his virility and theres a liverpool fighternamed billy the bull who claims he takes a teaspoon of bull semen beforeevery fight and says its made him a champion i myself have no problemsin the area of male sexuality but ive been considering—      oscar spare me the details please just tell me more about this drlacroix      thats about all i know hes a doctor who has tuned in on a needaching to be filled—eternal youth let me tell you something about youththere is absolutely nothing in the world but youth women want to returnto the blush of youth and beauty men want back those halcyon days whenthey bedded the headmasters daughter and then went on to row for oxfordand they will pay anything to get it naturally rejuvenation is restricted toonly the rich because the poor are too busy finding food and shelter toworry about what they look like nowadays people know the price ofeverything and the value of nothing       youre cynical oscar       nellie my dear society runs on looks i know now that when oneloses ones good looks whatever they may be one loses everythingshocking but true one day you will discover i am merely honest in aworld in which people hide their motives deeper than their money hereaches across and pats my hand nellie dearest you have fled mytirades       no im just confused which isnt an uncommon state of mind forme i find a connection between the doctor in bath and hailey hard toswallow bath is what over a hundred miles from here two or three hoursby train and while the story about the doctor and the society woman maytitillate london society where the names of the people are known its notthe sort of story that would interest readers on the other side of the atlanticfor long       nellie as i so adequately put it in my book the search for beauty isthe real secret of life that said my dear this is not just a story about adoctor in bath and a london society woman but a story about a doctor whois trying to sell eternal youth something even you barbaric americanswould find interesting       before i can object he holds up his hand as you get older you willunderstand in the meantime if you change your mind i have a friend inbath lady callista chilcott who ill refer you to if you want to follow upon gossip about the doctor i know she has been treated for that terribledisease called ugly old age by the doctor       i shake my head i dont think i will be pursuing the story       i just rained on your murder theory       no not at all you merely narrowed down my theories i dont see aconnection between hailey and the bath doctor if bath and the fountain ofyouth are out there is still the wealthy man who would kill to hide an affairwith an american woman that produces an illegitimate child       i meet oscars eye hes out there and im going to find himi like hearing myself talk it is one of my greatest pleasures i often have longconversations all by myself and i am so clever that sometimes i dont understand asingle word of what i am saying                                                                —oscar wilde                                     17by the time i leave oscar i have a headache despite his many funny storiesand perfectly outrageous observations of people and society in general thepain in my head comes from my confused state of mind      after i kiss oscar goodbye in the french cheekandcheek fashion—he spends a great deal of time in paris—and board a hansom back to myhotel my thoughts are muddled im basically at a loss as what to do next      if it wasnt the dead of night i could let the sights of the city occupymy mind but there is nothing to see after my cab leaves the glittering westend everything is dark and shut down with an occasional gaslight glowingin the mist the wet city streets are rolled up for the night so i lean backshut my eyes and listen to the clipclop of the hooves on cobblestones andthe heavy breathing of the hansom cab driver from his elevated seat aboveme      what a day what a life i am exhausted fatigued ready to drop      i have hardly stopped running since i broke the madhouse story threeyears ago a doctor told me i am suffering from fatigue pure exhaustionis what he labeled it and said i should slow down but i never seem to havethe time nor the opportunity      if i let sleeping dogs lie and give up my chase for haileys killer—andi have not a clue about her rich man except that he might have blue eyes—ican go home take some time off and get the muchneeded rest my bodycraves before deciding what i want to do with my career      but then i would be deserting hailey and everyone would continuebelieving she killed herself how can i do this when im not convinced thatshe did and even if i had absolute proof that she had taken her own lifebecause she was betrayed by her lover my attitude toward those who harmothers is definitely old testament—an eye for an eye the biblical phrasehas been called the law of retaliation and even though it is unladylike andlacking in christian charity as far as im concerned the lover can burn inthe hell of public ridicule with his reputation sullied      or am i just fooling myself because i desperately want to believe shedidnt commit suicide as inspector abberline so adequately told me notonce but twice      even dear oscar who loves a good chase said give up the ghost andgo home nellie      my cab stops and i open my eyes somehow i must have dozed off forit seems like i just left the langham and now im in front of my hotel      i give the doorman a grave smile as he helps me out all i want to dois get in bed and forget everything maybe sleep will bring answers      rats im just about to enter the lobby when i realize i didnt tip thedoorman i reach into the pocket of my coat where i keep a small hoard ofcoins for taxis and pull one out along with a small scrap of paper      as i walk across the lobby i glance down at the piece of paper      my feet come to a screeching halt      its a ticket stub for a train to bath                                     18bath the waters of life dr lacroix and the wealthy noblewoman seekingeternal youth      i sit in my room on my bed examining the train ticket stub for theumpteenth time no matter how i look at it how i read the words andnumbers it is obvious that the ticket is one to bath—issued the day beforehailey killed herself      it must have been in the diary and slipped out when i stuck the book inmy pocket or as i pulled the book out to put in my purse      so many stunning pieces to the puzzle have fallen into place that i amquietly contemplative rather than wildly excited      no longer do i have the slightest doubt that hailey her lover and thenews story are intertwined i dont know how they relate but shortly beforeher death hailey had set off for bath it may have been just one trip ofseveral to research a story about the death of the baronets wife      now not by choice but by necessity i am going to bath      it makes no difference that its after midnight i make my plans rightaway and prepare a telegraph for both oscar and inspector abberlineinforming them i am going to bath and requesting their assistance      wasting no time i go down to the telegraph kiosk in the hotel lobbyand prepare wires      in my telegram to oscar i ask for an introduction to the societymatron lady callista chilcott who he said has had treatments at the aquavitea spa i also tell oscar to tell the woman that i am doing a story aboutthe spa and not to mention hailey if she is a patron of the spa i doubt shewould not be cooperative about intentionally revealing a scandal      from the police inspector i request the name and an introduction to ifhe would be so kind the police official in bath who is in charge of thedeath of lady winsworth at the spa wording the request as if i were simplyresearching a story as opposed to sticking my nose in a police investigation      the police inspector would not appreciate a knock on his door thislate and im sure oscar will not be in for hours so my instructions are thatthe two missives be delivered first thing in the morning with a request thatthe messenger boy take an immediate reply       i dont know how people communicated before the telegraph wirerevolutionized communications i can hardly function without it gettingmail delivered to the office three times a day in new york is simplyinadequate especially since it took days or even weeks to get theresending a telegraph across town or around the world then having a boyrush it by foot or bike to the recipient the feat often accomplished in lessthan an hour from almost anywhere has brought the entire civilized portionof the world into contact       as i leave the cable kiosk in the hotel lobby i cant help notice onlybecause of the lateness of night a man sitting in one of the lobby chairswith his head buried in a newspaper poor fellow i hope he hasnt beenstood up for he appears to be waiting for someone—dressed in a raincoathat with an umbrella all ready to leave       on my way up the elevator back to my room a chilling thoughtfollows me what if hailey was killed because of the story       maybe her married lover killed her to stop a scandal that would ruinhis reputation im unsure whether he has anything to do with the newsstory she was working on perhaps that was how they met       another angle is that hailey had been killed because of what she foundout about the story and her lover had nothing to do with her death       my head is pounding so before i leave the lobby i request a glass ofhot milk a cookie and headache powder be sent to my room i hate milkbut my mother always insists that it helps put me to sleep shes right butill still have to force it down as bitter medicine                                     as soon as nellie left the lobby the man with his face in the newspaper getsup and goes to the telegraph kiosk taking the pad he had watched nelliebly write two telegrams on he tears off the top sheet     wish to send a wire the attendant asks     need to think out what i want to say     he puts the blank sheet in his pocket to keep it dry and leaves thehotel ignoring a waiting taxi he heads down the street to a pub     after ordering a pint he removes the blank sheet and begins to lightlyrun a lead pencil over the imprints nellies messages had left on the paper     holding it up to the light he says to himself lets see what youre upto     the bartender sets down the pint in front of him     got a problem with your lady he asks     pardon     the bartender nods at the telegram message the blueeyed man istrying to read     pal of mine did that once caught his missus sending off a wire to herlover     ah yes yes quite very perceptive of you yes im checking outwhere my uh friend is off to     see anything on the paper     yes shes going to bath                                     19the next morning a discreet tap on my door by a bellman brought replies tomy wires     nellie dear i have notified lady callista chilcott of your wish for an     audience and she has consented i told her you are a dear friend of     mine

more than curtsy for information     i dread opening the inspectors response i know hes already nothappy with my reluctance to accept that hailey committed suicide hebelieves im not willing to face the sad truth as he calls it and thereforelooking to find a reason for murder i also know hes doesnt like the idea ofme interfering with police business     chief inspector john bradley will be available to answer questions     and help you in any way in regards to your research                                 your faithful servant inspector abberline     ps do i smell something more than a story with your quest     all right my soldiers are lined up it is time to cross the rubicon                                     as i wait to board the train to bath i cant help staring up at the glazedroof and massive wroughtiron arches of paddington station     absolutely amazing… i say to myself     yes it truly is      an elderly british gentleman wearing a top hat a thick black woolwinter coat with a white silk scarf wrapped around his neck approachesme      please excuse me he tips his hat i normally dont eavesdrop…      oh … no … its just that im from america and we dont haveanything like this      nobody does it is the first underground railway system in the worldand the original western terminus of the metropolitan railway      really…      the roof that youve been admiring is six hundred and ninetyninefeet long and the gigantic arches supporting it span sixtyeight feet      he looks up at it and i can feel his pride cant blame him itsdefinitely an incredible feat he tips his hat and is off to catch a train      finally my train comes it is midday and the train ride will take abouttwo hours or so to reach bath      as soon as we are rolling i leave my valise on my seat and make myway to the dining car i had rushed out of the hotel too late to grab a bite      the dining facilities are pleasant tables have linen tablecloths chinapolished silverware and theres even a vase in the center of each tableholding a pink carnation      at the end of the train car is a table for one—perfect for me      as i make my way toward my table i notice a young gentlemanlooking down at a newspaper on the table across from the one i am headingfor he sports a mustache that isnt overpowering and light brown hair iwould venture to guess he is in his midtwenties close to my age      something about him is vaguely familiar to me but i cant place it      he lifts his head and i inadvertently meet his eyes and get a jolt—hiseyes are blue      his countenance is rather grave and stoic but his striking blue eyesalmost cause me to miss a step      i focus straight ahead and take my seat quickly grabbing a menu ipretend to be absorbed by the sparse offerings while thoughts whip throughmy brain      the man with his head buried in a newspaper was in the hotel lobbylast night i couldnt be certain it is the same man i didnt see his face at thehotel but the general form of his body …      i am dying to take another peek at him and force myself to pretend tojust be casually looking around as i turn—damnit i meet his eye again      embarrassed at being caught i do what comes natural to me i attack      you were in the hotel lobby last night      he smiles and shakes his head ich bin fraulein traurig aber ichspreche nicht englisch he smiles no anglish      oh lord how embarrassing i dont speak german but caught the facthe doesnt speak english now i am even more embarrassed      sorry i turn away from him and try to bury my head in the smallmenu im mortified he must think that im some sort of hussyapproaching him in public oh no did he understand the word hotelcould i have left him with the impression that i—i—      i turn back around to try and get across to him what i meant byspeaking about a hotel but he rises and leaves and i close my trap ratherthan sticking my foot in it again      how asinine of me even if he had been the man i saw at the hotel lastnight bumping into him on the train the next morning would be perfectlynatural      i order tea and a roast beef sandwich and sit back with a sigh a littleweary a little lonely he had been a reasonably attractive man and appearedintelligent it would have been nice to wile away the time it took to get tobath just talking to him about everyday things that didnt include murderand suicide      however there had been no romantic interest in his look not that thereshould be but i find it strange and get the feeling in that brief encounterthat he was analyzing me more like a scientist observing something ofprofessional interest rather than as a man looking at a woman he might findattractive not a cool dispassionate look but a probing one      maybe hes a scientist the germans are so clever about that sort ofthing      my cheeks burn again at the embarrassing notion i might have lefthim one thing for certain—i will be happy never to see the likes of himagain not only because of my slip but thinking about it i wonder why hedidnt at least try to start up a conversation even with the language problemin other words whats so wrong with me that the man only looked at melike i am a bug under a microscope      i know thoughts like that are my inadequacies acting up i dont thinkim attractive and react poorly when i believe a man doesnt find meattractive sort of a loselose attitude even if a man finds me interesting asa lady i am forbidden by convention to show that i am attracted to himwhoever made up that rule forgot that women have a need for intimacy justas a man does and perhaps in a less frantic manner even a greater need      am i lonely yes and when women commonly are married byeighteen i am bordering on being an old maid its not that i dislike men—to the contrary i just havent found the man i want to share my life with      and i must say the rule that women are supposed to marry early andwhether or not they want to annoys me i will marry when i please and if iam old and ugly—uglier than i already am—then i will just have to find aman who loves me for who i am of course shallow as i am if there reallyis something that would keep me young id buy that too                                      my valise is gone blurts out of my mouth when i return to my seat afterlunch     its all right dear i have it     a middleaged woman doing needlework across the aisle nods at theseat beside her feet she sets down her needlework and hands the valise tome     im afraid i may have stuck my nose in your business i saw a maneyeing it a while ago and i took the precaution of safeguarding it im sure iwas just being silly but i hoped you wouldnt be offended     no not at all i really do appreciate it     its my pleasure miss…     cochran elizabeth cochran i

reporter whichshe cant get over and says more than once im so impressed what anaccomplishment for such a young lady and about hailey—not everythingjust tidbits here and there shes very sympathetic i must admit it feelsgood to speak to another woman     so why are you going to bath     im just tracing haileys steps and i believe she was investigatingthe aqua vitae spa and a dr lacroix—something to do with the death of alady winsworth     oh my mrs lambert puts her hand to her chest     are you okay     oh yes yes im sorry i didnt mean to startle you but its just thatmy sister bless her heart

reason to go are we going to be okay because nowthat you mention it i remember reading something about that poor lady andhow the police are investigating it but they arent certain if the spa

                                                                       —john 414                                     20                               bath englandthe aqua vitae spa sits on a slope at a higher level than the roman ruins       the ruins are what is left of a spa built nearly two thousand years agowhen the town was called aquae sulis and the region was the romanprovince of britannia mrs lambert told me on the train that the baths arestill in use but the moneyed crowd naturally frequented luxurious privatespas like that of dr lacroixs       i have the cabbie drop me off at the ancient ruins and i walk slowly upto the spa gathering my thoughts i cant barge in and ask the first person imeet if the doctor in charge is involved in the death of hailey mcguire       not able to think of a clever approach to getting information i do whati always do when i am in doubt force myself to put one foot in front of theother and go forward and play it by ear       the spa has the appearance of a greek or roman temple with doriccolumns the entire structure or at least the façade for sure is marble abuilding material that always translates as very expensive       as i am nearing the building an enclosed black town coach fit for aqueen with a driver and footman drawn by two black stallions pulls upand stops deep velvet burgundy window curtains hide whoever is insidewhich obviously piques my always nosey interest       the footman leaps down from his perch at the rear of the coach andopens the carriage door as the spa doorman comes forward with a parasol toshade the woman from the not very bright sun the carriage door bears acoat of arms but even at a distance i can see that it has been discreetlycovered over       the woman who emerges from the carriage is dressed all in black—elegant black silk dress black hat and veil black gloves and a small blackbeaded chatelaine purse       i wonder what she has in the purse attached to a waist belt chatelaineswere originally a chain with necessary household items attached womenhooked them on their belts and put keys scissors or other handy items onthem      according to the queens magazine chatelaine purses have become aladies fashion item in which women carry not just a handkerchief lipstickor a card case but secret things—like love letters they dont want out oftheir possession      the doorman whom im glad to see is dressed in a uniform rather thana roman toga escorts her inside      from what oscar told me about the spa the woman could be visitingfor medicinal reasons or rejuvenation whatever they are she definitelydoesnt want anyone to know who she is everything about her spellsimmense wealth and nobility perhaps even royalty and drama to really besuccessful at maintaining a low profile riding in a luxurious coach with itscoat of arms would not be the best way oscars comment about hiding inplain sight probably would protect the woman more from the eyes of thecurious than a funeral getup      the carriage has drawn away as i approach and the doorman gives mea onceover he is obviously not used to women arriving on foot i resist thetemptation to tell him that my only mode of transportation is by shanksmare and merely give him a small smile      he ushers me in and i quickly glance around to see if the mystery ladyis about nope she probably was immediately whisked off to some veryprivate room      my first impression of the aqua vitae spa is grace and serenity      the entryway opens into a large glass domed area the walls arecovered with murals scattered against the walls between the wall paintingsare largeleaf green plants—tropical palms and ferns intermeshed in thegreenery are exotically colored flowering plants in elegant chinese ceramicpots the atmosphere evokes a feeling of beauty mixed with earthiness      all the murals have the same theme young healthy men and womennaked but portrayed with some modesty in a garden of eden settingappropriate since that is where it all began … or so the bible says      a string quartet dressed in white are on an elevated dais at the far endof the room filling the place with a soft dreamy melody      in the center of the room is a marble fountain with aphrodite andmichelangelos david getting wet from water gurgling out of jugs held bystone cupids the water is not crystal clear but appropriately has the lookand warm salty smell of mineral spring water no doubt from the spring thespa sits upon the message the room gives is clear enough the spaswaters make people look beautiful and stay young      a vibrant blond woman in a glowing white uniform with her hairpulled tightly back into a bun approaches me the impression is that of anelegant but energetic nurse      good afternoon i am miss carter a therapeutic consultant have youtreated with our doctors before      no this is my first visit your facility was recommended by a friendin london      excellent may we have the friends name so we can thank her      she wants the friends name to rate my finances of course its a heactually oscar wilde      mr wilde hasnt treated with us but many of the people in his socialcircles are our patients youre american miss…      elizabeth cochran      welcome miss cochran many americans come for our treatmentsshe rattles off family names that read like a list of whos who in big bankaccounts—vanderbilt rockefeller gould all of whom she says have cometo aqua vitae to take the water cure      ive heard people many times refer to visiting mineral springs to takethe water cure but when you ask what they were curing the onlyresponses i ever found credible were arthritic complaints      knowing from the lack of a wedding ring on my finger that i am notmarried she inquires about the health of my parents in a clever way tofind out what my father does for a living heaven forbid i actually makeenough money working to pay for this myself once im done with solvinghaileys murder im going to do an article about independent women whocan stand on their own two feet without the assistance of their fatherswealth or the need of a husband i know we are far and few between butthings will change mark my words      to appease her i casually refer to mining and railroads since thoseare the basis for most of the great wealth in america      are you suffering from a particular ailment for which you seektreatment she asks      too young to claim i need to shed years i resort to the truth imrather worn out fatigued my mother describes my condition as tiredblood      your mother is quite correct tired blood is a serious epidemic amongyoung women as they try to please both their parents and the man in theirlife and very important it affects your ability to keep a youthfulappearance let me introduce you to our medical facility that isadministered by doctors      doctors medical facility therapeutic ailment treatment epidemic …she has been dropping loaded references to the legitimate medicalprofession since the moment i entered i guess she really wants to get acrossthat they are not just selling any kind of snake oil but curatives with realmedical science behind them uh huh      i give them credit for one thing the place is so antiseptic dr pasteurthe great microbe hunter would have a hard time finding germs here      this is our reception area in which you may relax until you are calledfor a treatment she shows me an area with dark blue couches a maid isserving fruit drinks and offering hors doeuvres to women we alternatetimes for women and men for the sake of modesty though there are spas ineurope which permit bathing by both sexes at the same time      as i was arriving i saw a woman enter dressed all in black iwondered if she was a woman i met recently in london      i cant tell you its our policy to respect the privacy of our guests      im tempted to remind her that she had no problem tossing out thenames of prominent people from america but i keep my mouth shut      we enter a sterile white padded room that has a wicker chaise longuein the center and one metal chair to its far right across from them in acorner is a table with some medical looking items on it and on the floor is alarge water hose      this room is exclusive just for women its called our fainting room      fainting room      yes for centuries women have been suffering from a very commonailment called female hysteria our spa is the first to offer a full line oftreatment for this painful medical condition12      what are the symptoms      they vary but the most common are nervous anxiety a tendency tofeel faint irritation a feeling of loneliness and rejection and a tendency tobe argumentative she pauses and gives me a dark look there is oftenalso incidences of selfabuse      i nod my head ah selfabuse is masturbation a habit that many inthe medical profession believe can lead to insanity or other direconsequences      there didnt seem to be much medical apparatus in the room the twomost distinguishable items being a long tube about as round as a fire hoseand the wicker chaise longue      how do you treat the condition      our most common treatment is having a woman recline on the chaiselongue while the doctor or a midwife hand massages her pelvic area untilshe experiences hysterical paroxysm which is usually a sudden outburstthat can be very loud and sometimes violent thats why we have the wallspadded we strive for privacy      privacy … yes that would be important holy mackerel hystericalparoxysm is what naughty girls in school used to whisper is a femaleorgasm      we also have the hydrotherapy treatment for women who prefer thatmethod a woman sits naked in that chair and her pelvic area is sprayedwith that hose      what      the womans eyebrows fly up its quite safe we use only our warmmineral water for many it is very effective in bringing about theparoxysm      i bet it is      she points to a large machine against the wall we also have thenewest medical apparatus for treating the condition this is an electricvibrator which shortens the treatment from hours to minutes and that sheindicates a narrow metal rod with a rounded head is a speculum that isinserted into a womans vagina to stimulate the paroxysm      she smiles rather dreamily our goal is to give the patients differentchoices to aid them in finding a release of their symptom by experiencinghysterical paroxysm      i just nod my head       for once in my life i honestly have nothing to say i dont knowwhether i should break out laughing or cry because so many women get solittle of the passionate affection god created them to receive that they haveto enlist huge vibrating machines or a fire hose or manual manipulation forrelief                          inside the roman bath                                      21we leave the feminine chamber of horrors      now im going to take you into a room called the garden of edenbecause that is where it all began—life love eternal youth however imust insist on no talking youll see why      we enter a room that has a round stone fountain in the center of it itsmedieval looking with crudely carved stone images of the garden of eden—a naked man and woman wearing fig leaves and a snake hanging from anapple tree in the center of the pool of water is one spout with milky watercoming out of it      scattered around the fountain are lounge chairs like the one in thefainting room only they are made of wrought iron and the people appearto be sleeping—no hankypanky is going on in here beside each chair is asmall round stone pedestal table on each one is a golden goblet filledim sure with water from the fountain the floor is made of stones and onthe walls are trestles filled with vines that have mingled with purple belllike flowers      two barefooted women dressed in white silk tunics walk aroundholding a stone pitcher they check the goblets and fill the ones that needthe milky water      the whole ambience is to make you feel like you have walked into aserene atmosphere where you can completely relax and id have to saythey did a very good job      we quietly exit another door that is across the room from the one weentered      what you just saw is our fountain that dispenses the elixir of life thewaters of eternal life and rejuvenation ponce de leon looked for thefountain of youth and didnt realize it could be created our doctors havedeveloped a very unique drink that is pure yet filled with ingredients thathave rejuvenating powers      so youve found the philosophers stone … the legendary drink thatgrants eternal life     no our drink wont permit you to live forever but it will certainlyhelp you live longer and better and it does aid in getting back youthfulvigor with that renewed energy our patients rediscover some of the blushof youth they once had     splitting hairs is what my mother would call it not to mention thatwith vague generalities about vigor they are really not committing toanything i decide to try and pin her down     basically your doctors are chemists who claim to have developed apotion for helping to achieve youth     they are not chemists they are medical doctors and they are notclaiming she almost spits her words at me miss cochran you have avery closed mind have you considered that you might be suffering fromfemale hysteria instead of tired blood     what     i noticed the symptoms as soon as i saw you you are tense andholding back your emotions that of course inevitably leads to outburstsof hysteria that are relieved by paroxysm     i button my lips because i am about to have a paroxysm that will landher on the floor and me out the door but keeping a volcanic outburst fromexploding leaves me trembling with rage in my shoes what a bitch myfriend sarah bernhardt would have said about this woman or probably toher face     dont worry miss cochran we have everything that is needed tomake you well and a whole woman again we have a facility that is perfectfor you at this moment its a place to relax in a pool of our mineral waterto wash away some of the tensions of life something you desperatelyneed     that i couldnt agree with her more if i dont release some tensionsoon i will lose control of my hands and they will find their way to herneck and throttle her     she proceeds to take me to a pump room where the spring watersgurgle into a marble pool     here the waters are divided with some diverted for internal use andthe rest for our bathing treatments     she gives me a sample of the mineral water which tastes like it smellsi wrinkle my nose why does medicine always have to taste awful to begood for you      the water comes from the deep bowels of the earth bringing forth thehealing powers of mother nature herself these are ancient waters—celticpriests experienced the curative effects of the springs long before theromans      she then takes me into a small room that is hot and wet and just plainstinks      unlike most spas that crowd people into a single pool we have a bathand pool for every guest      the bath is a pit of mud about the size of a bathtub and the pool isspring water in a basin about twice that big      not mud she corrects me when i comment on how bad the bathsmells this is peat moss from bogs in dartmoor that are older thanrecorded history it is one of the trade secrets that make aqua vitae thepremier curative spa in the world      the peat moss ive seen in bogs marshes and swamps dont lookvery healthy to me or smell that way what does peat moss do for you      the substance we use is not what you see on the surface but thedecayed organic sphagnum materials beneath im sure you know thatanimals and humans who fell into peat bogs thousands of years ago havebeen recovered with flesh and bone perfectly preserved can you imaginethat buried in a bog for thousands of years and their features unaltered      haraldskaer woman i say recalling a story a fellow reporter haddone on the subject people believe she was a queen of the danes who waskilled over two thousand years ago murdered buried naked her clotheslaid atop her      the therapeutic consultant appears a bit taken back at my connectingmurder with curative waters      i give her a smile and youre right she was well preserved      quite well as i was saying the fact that peat moss preserves fleshand bone in a natural state is one of the secrets discovered by our medicalstaff      was it dr lacroix who made the discovery      oh no although dr lacroix has greatly improved the process henow takes a different approach the curative and rejuvenation powers ofpeat moss were first discovered by dr radic the managing director ofaqua vitae when he was a physician in romania       what is dr lacroixs approach       im afraid im not at liberty to discuss that with you dr radic willexamine you and set out a course of treatment to restore your damagedhealth before it is too late and your condition becomes irreversible       my friend referred me to dr lacroix id prefer to see him       as i said dr lacroix is not available       when will he be available       he—i dont know hes vacationing—researching—on the continentits time for you to see dr radic       i hoped i hadnt pushed her too far this time she is really flustered andannoyed her pretense at friendliness has gone and her guard is up i keepmy mouth shut as i follow her into a sitting room       please have a seat dr radic will be with you shortly she sayscurtly       i take a seat next to the door she disappears through with my back tothe wall antsy i get up and pace the room back and forth to my surprise isee out the window the lady in black getting into her carriage i wonderwhat type of treatment she was in for it couldnt have been much of one ialso notice she is no longer carrying her chatelaine purse with her       thats odd…       whats odd miss carter startles me from behind       ah … nothing       the doctor will be with you shortly she politely tells me but with arigid body then leaves for the main area       the door into the doctors office has not quite clicked shut behind heri hear voices and give a quick look around to make sure i am not beingwatched and then give the door a nudge so it opens a foot wider and bendmy ear in the direction of the voices       a woman is sobbing and speaks in a drunken slur i want to see mylittle emma       you know your child died from brain fever comes from a malevoice spoken in english with a heavy balkan accent dr radic i presumethe discoverer of the miracle peat moss treatment in romania       but she was a healthy child the woman slurs     on the surface but brain fever strikes fast     i have never understood what brain fever is one hears it frequentlyas a cause of illness and death and i abide by my wise mothers definitionof the ailment its what people die of when the doctor cant find the realreason                         a view of bath england     here get some nourishment i hear the doctor say i dont knowwhat he gave her but from her mumbled thanks and the fact the womansounds drunk i suspect hes giving her money that will be spent in a ginmill rather than at a grocer     take her out the back way the balkan voice says     i lean back and freeze in place as the door opens and a tearful womancomes out with a man behind her     this way sarah the man grabs the woman by the elbow and divertsher to a door to my left as he glances back at me     two things are obvious sarah is a gin hag and most likely a prostituteon her last days earning a living on her back before she gives up the ghostfacedown in a gutter     the man with her is a ruffian the kind found hanging around saloonsacting as bouncers when theyre not mugging drunks in an alley he has anunusual item of dress for a brit—pointedtoe cowboy boots      neither the woman nor the ruffian are the types one would expect tofind at a health spa servicing the rich      a tall thin man with narrow hawklike features and black piercingeyes enters from the room i had been eavesdropping upon      i stand up and offer him my hand to shake an unexpected movementthat almost always throws men off their guard      elizabeth cochran      im going to have you arrested for trespassing he says                                     22you have entered my premises under a fake name and false pretenses theman with the balkan accent says who i assume is dr radic you will findto your regret that our premises are held in high regard by the local police      the saloon ruffian pops back in need some help here dr radic      hold this woman for the police dr radic says he turns back to meyou can explain your actions to the police      i shall be happy to talk to the police dr radic in fact inspectorabberline of scotland yard knows i am here and im meeting with chiefinspector bradley when i leave here      i look him squarely in the face as soon as i am through reporting thesexual activities taking place here to the police i shall get out the story toevery newspaper in bath and london      there are no sexual activities on the premises what you observed arestandard medical procedures      what i observed was revolting sexual stimulation and tortures thatwhen exposed will not only make you a laughingstock but prompt policeaction i lock eyes with him if you know my name doctor you mustknow my success at exposing the dirty laundry of medical practitioners      i go around him heading for the door when the thug starts toward me      stop i snap      he freezes      come one step closer to me and i will give out the most horrendousbloodcurdling screams that you have ever heard would you like that drradic perhaps some cries of rape and murder      radic waves the man back its okay burke ill take care of this      the man gives me a dirty look as he backs off and goes through thedoor that he had entered from      radic faces me i can see from his expression that he isnt intimidatedby my threats rather my impression is that of a man of expediency—battling me on his public premises just isnt advantageous      get out of my sight and dont come back stick your nose in mybusiness and i wont be able to guarantee your safety      obviously i wouldnt be the first woman who came to a sudden enddealing with this place did lady winsworth cross you too      i flee taking my big mouth with me running as fast as my short legsand small feet will take me i had expected i might be caught and itwouldnt be the first time id had a runin with a charlatan like dr radic ifhe is in fact a doctor but it isnt often i find myself having to verbally fightmy way out of an upperclass establishment with a threat from a saloon lout—after encountering a poor bedeviled street gin hag      the waters of life have some strange bedfellows that is for sure      my feet are moving quickly not only because i want to get far awaybefore i end up preserved in peat moss but because i want to have a talkwith sarah      what in heavens name could the gin hag her daughter and dr radichave to do with each other the woman obviously couldnt have hiredradic to treat her child nor did radic strike me as a charitable soul whowould take in mudlarks and let them freely partake in the curative watersthat the rich pay so dearly to quaff down      my gut is screaming that something stinks in denmark and its not justthe smell of bog mudthe art of ignoring is one of the accomplishments of every wellbred girl so carefullyinstilled that at last she can even ignore her own thoughts and her own knowledge                                                       —h g wells ann veronica                                     23herbert george wells bertie to his family h g to others stands in thesheltered doorway of a closed shop and watches as the american newspaperreporter comes out of the spa he finds it curious that she seems to berushing out instead of just walking at a normal pace      he knows who she is knew who she was when he stared at her on thetrain trying to dissect her and understand her with his probing blue eyesalmost succumbing to the temptation of stealing her valise he would havestolen the valise if the nosey woman on the train had not scared him off      she continues to walk fast as if she is hurrying somewhere—no hechanges his mind as he watches her glance around shes looking forsomeone      she goes up the street to the corner and disappears around it hedoesnt know where she is heading but he had already looked over that areaand knows that there is a dead end alley there a fact she will soon discoverhe stays where he is because he doesnt want her bumping into him whenshe is retreating      wells is impressed with many things about her especially hervibrancy he senses that like himself nellie bly is not a particularly happyperson he finds that puzzling since the young woman has climbed to careerheights in such a short time there are not many men and few if anywomen who have succeeded like she has      he himself viewed life as a challenge and attacked it as a mountainclimber would a high peak but the concentration the battle to succeed wasa trying one for someone from the lower classes in a classconscioussociety      he knows that people close to him often call him an angry young manand they are right much of his distemper comes from the fact that he is notsatisfied with the way his life has gone or is going which is a terriblequality he acquired from his mother sarah she has never been satisfiedwith her life and constantly says i dread my time so much…     he knows his mother will die unhappy and fears he will too she hasalways desired desperately to rise above being a domestic servant shedespises that she is of the lower classes and calls it a curse the last time hetalked to her she told him she wishes god would soon release her     the memories of much of his childhood are not of the wondrous thingsmost children experience but of discord they were a poor family and oftenwent hungry a miserable half living is what his mother called it he wasborn in a house off high street of bromley in kent which is outside oflondon and lived there with his three brothers until he was a teenagereven though the home which was also his parents shop was called theatlas house it was an unpromising place to make a start in lifeaccording to his mother it had two tiny rooms a front room and back roomon each of its three floors the only source of heat in the house was thekitchen stove located in the illlit basement     his mother believes unconditionally in an allpowerful god a simplegod which she continually tried to push upon her children when they weregrowing up religion has always been the dominant force in her life ratherthan his father joseph religion was one of the wedges he believes torethem apart besides his fathers lack of ambition     she constantly told wells and his brothers that they must strive to beupstairs persons instead of downstairs persons which she labelsherself it is my awful fate in life to be in the servitude position of lifeboth in work and marriage     today she is still a ladys maid at uppark in a country house insussex     his father who is an outdoor person in domestic parlance and afreethinker remains a gardener and sometimes amateur cricket player whonever fit in well in anywhere except in front of a pint of ale at the local pubhis mother will never forgive him for losing the small crockery shop theyacquired after receiving a small inheritance and now they are no longerone but two people living apart separated by anger frustrationdisappointment and lost dreams     where is her simple god now wells wonders as far as he isconcerned her god cannot be trusted hes the old sneak     wells has to think hard to remember happy moments in his childhoodhe believes the sadness that would come to affect him began two yearsbefore he was born his parents lost their only daughter frances she wasnine years old and the pride of sarah      from birth his mother believed little bertie—he hates that she callshim that even to this day—was born into everlasting perdition on accountof their sins—the sins that took away their daughter      in time his parents were no longer able to support the familyfinancially and sarah the logical staunch protestant sought to place herboys as apprentices while his father continued floating through life      being his mothers wish wells was apprenticed to a drapery makerwhen he was thirteen—and again at fifteen—failing both times the drapersaid he was a daydreamer and he still is the last time he arrived at upparkhe announced to his mother that the bad shillings back again she fearshe will never amount to anything and be like his father a failure and afreethinker      he finally got a scholarship to the normal school—a place whereteachers are trained—and he studied to be a teaching assistant not a veryprestigious or wellpaying profession but at least he didnt spend hiswaking hours measuring cutting and sewing drapery materials somethinghis mother was very proud that her older sons accomplished      they now have a place in life sarah continually reminds him      wells realizes that his calling to education and science resulted from abroken leg as a child that made him bed bound for a long period duringwhich he read books that his father obtained from the library      reading became his only solace hed read every book he could gethis hands on so he could escape into a world of endless possibilities thebooks had not just been an escape to magic lands for him—not seeingaround him anyone he would want to emulate in life he had found that thecharacters in books were people he could relate to and aspire to be like      books shaped his aspirations to do something other than working withhis hands and his ideals about love and the pursuit of happiness he daredto dream and it was his freethinking father who lugged the books back andforth from the library for him his mother might have good reason to havelost love with his father but for wells he will always remember him fondlyfor bringing the books      it is because of his ideals about love that wells is now on the streetin bath following an american reporter as she attempts to make sense outof the death of a friend      the woman comes out of the dead end alley and he follows behind asshe keeps up a fast pace      hes impressed she has energy and determination qualities he likesand admires in a woman when she stared fearlessly back at him on thetrain challenging him he realized that she is not your everyday lady—things could get interesting      she pauses in front of a less than respectable pub stares at the door fora moment and then completely surprises him—she goes inside      this woman is bold or just plain stupid      a few minutes pass and hes wondering if he shouldnt go in andrescue her when she comes back outside steering a woman alongside herwho is obviously a prostitute to a bench      wells is surprised but not because hes a moralist to the contrary hesees nothing wrong with prostitution in fact the profession should beregulated and controlled for the sake of both the prostitutes and the menthey service not to mention the poor wives who suffer medically from theirindiscretions      but the unfortunate prostitute with the american reporter is not farfrom her last swig of the gin she drinks to kill the pain and shes probablyno more than thirty but looks like a badly used woman twice that age      they sit down and start talking      what in gods name does a poor saturated gin creature have to tellnellie bly                                     24the woman comes out of the pub with me only because i showed her aquid told her i needed to talk to her about little emma took her by the armand steered her out the door and into the sunlight      we face each other and i am saddened by what i see as i look into hereyes the wrinkles on her youngold face are scars of life her hair is dirtyand straggly her clothes appear not just slept in but lived in but its herglassy eyes that seem to come in and out of focus that tear at my heart onemoment her eyes clear to expose her damaged soul the next they cloudover with gin there is no fire in her little remnant of the animal cunningthat has kept her alive on the streets her life is quickly burning down likea fire no longer fueled or stroked      what do you want      im from the womens childrens charity rolls off my liquidtongue we want to talk to you about emma      emma isnt here right now      she starts to tear up i suspect that whatever terrible life this poorwoman has had got worse when she lost her daughter as horrible as a lifeon the streets would have been for the child she probably was the one thingthat kept her mother functioning she appears completely lost now andhopefully will find eternal peace before she suffers too much more she isso far gone nothing can be done for her—even the money i am going togive her will only help lessen the pain while hastening the end giving morewill most likely make her a victim of a robbery and a beating—or worse      emma passed away i whisper as gently as i can      emmas gone … shes gone      what happened to emma      brain fever      yes dr radic told me that emma was sick when you took her tohim to be treated      oh no emma was never sick she was amazing even dr radic saidso other children got sick but not emma he said she was the healthiestchild hed ever seen     then why was dr radic treating her for brain fever     i dont know i just dont know she went to stay at the spa for a dayand they paid me again and told me they were keeping her overnight icame to pick her up the next day and they said she had to stay cause shehad a fever     she had no fever before you took her over     emma was never sick     how long did they keep her before she uh passed—     they told me that the brain fever had taken her the previous nightwhen i came to pick her up she was dead my sweet baby was pale like aghost sleeping and i couldnt wake her up     did they tell you what caused her condition     they said children die all the time from fevers     that is true but they usually dont have an illness that goes fromperfectly healthy to terminal overnight     if emma wasnt sick i ask when you took her to the spa what wasthe reason for her being treated there     my baby wasnt being treated she was helping others     come again     the doctor said she was so young and healthy that she could helpsick old people get well     how did she help sick people get well     she was a good girl     but what exactly did she do to help the sick     she was healthy the doctor said she was young and healthy andcould help     was it dr lacroix or dr radic who told you emma could helpothers     the younger one dr lacroix     her eyes are clouding over she appears not to have any notion of whatwent on at the spa and neither do i a child goes in … for what and isdead the next morning     could something macabre or satanic have occurred or is it a medicaltreatment that went radically wrong just as another one did     have you ever heard of lady winsworth i ask sarah      she shakes her head      did lacroix say anything about little emma helping a particularperson      another shake      she looks as if she is having difficulty focusing and i am feeling a bitqueasy myself talking to a street woman about the mysterious fate of asmall child is getting me nauseated i need to get away from her and try tomake some sense of what she told me      i pay her and flee as fast as my feet can take me my head once againswirling with facts that dont add up and information that i cant digest      what in gods name could dr lacroix and dr radic and their snakeoil salespeople have been doing at the fashionable spa with a small childdid they have her sit next to old people in hopes that the sight of her wouldmake them younger—a macabre thought no doubt generated in my head byoscars tale of a painting that grew old while its subject stayed young      did they have her bathe in the spring waters so some youthful essencewashed off her and into the waters others bathed in—or drank      all the scenarios i could think of sound bizarre but i remind myselfthat the health claims of the spa are pretty fantastic      i wish oscar was here to help me he has an incredible mind and inmatters of beauty and what people would do well he might have someideas maybe ill telegram him my findings      first i need to eat to help settle my stomach      i find a pub that serves pasties a favorite of mine—theyre meat andpotato pies used by cornish miners as a compact handheld meal theminers brought them to american mining towns the pasty and hot teawork perfectly the food not only settles my stomach but the baked smellof the meat potatoes and dough brings nice memories that help wash awaythe pain in sarahs face      something my mother always says when she sees someone who hassuffered the bad life of this world comes to mind there but for the grace ofgod go any of us      checking back at my hotel there are telegrams from both chiefinspector bradley and lady chilcott—both will see me      good as oscars friend arthur conan doyle would say the gamesafoot                                     25chief inspector bradley is about forty younger than inspector abberlinealso thinner and taller with bushy prematurely gray hair retreating from thefront of his head he has a solid almost stern cast to his features whileabberline has a little room for humor in his      stiff upper lip type that very british exercise of selfrestraint in theexpression of emotion is how i peg him      his office is small not a cubbyhole because he is a chief inspector butit shows few personal effects his desk is a library table heaped high withstacks of papers with chairs drawn up to it      i imagine his officers gather around his desk to discuss cases thereare ashtrays the size of plates scattered about and i would bet id spot aspittoon or two if i took a peek under the table      have a good trip across the pond he asks as he leans back in hisswivel chair and prepares a pipe      from the look he is giving me i suspect that preparing a pipe helps himkill time as he sizes me up      atlantic storm put me at the rail a good bit of the way i love the seabut hate the way it bounces great ships around with me on them like theywere toys      he chuckles and eyes me as he sends up a cloud of aromatic pipetobacco smoke that has a hint of blackberry      i know this will not be as comfortable as dealing with inspectorabberline the look i am getting from the chief inspector is one of cautionbath is a small community compared to london and has an overabundanceof the wealthy and titled drawn here because of the spas that no doubtdraws considerably more attention on the police than in a large metropolitanarea      never cared for the sea myself another cloud of smoke and then hemoves his first piece in the game of policeman versus reporter doing astory on the death of lady winsworth he asks      actually im doing a story on the spa and the marvelous cures theyclaim but yes it would be hard to do a story about the facility and notmention that someone died from the treatment      now theres no evidence of that the coroners investigation is stillopen as to the cause of death we still have other avenues to investigatebefore a verdict will be rendered      i guess i was misinformed my understanding is that her ladyshipdied after receiving treatment at the spa      theres no question she drank some of those concoctions they chargean arm and a leg for at the place but so have hundreds of other people andstill do first thing the medical examiner did was look for poison and hefound none      what did she die of      now thats a question that falls in the bailiwick of the medicalexaminer and his boss the coroner but i can tell you this—they just dontknow yet could be something she ate or drank but as i said she consumedwhat others did      what does dr lacroix say happened      now miss you do know the questions to ask that i dont haveanswers for the doctor left for the continent soon after lady winsworthdied and we havent been able to talk to him      rather convenient      he shrugs to some it plays that way but we were shown proof thatthe trip was planned well before her ladyship passed we have questionedlacroixs partner dr radic and he gave a list of what she had ingestedbasically the same as everyone else he eyed me some more through thesmoke you understand that this matter is being given very specialattention not ignored      i nod lord winsworth is a very important man      quite so but there are also plenty of other highmucketymucks whoswear by the spa and believe what they drink and bathe in there relievestheir aching old bones or will turn them young and beautiful again      which means from the standpoint of the coroners office its a hotpotato and no decision will be made until the medical examiner isabsolutely certain      more blank stares through the smoke screen tell me that i have gottenall i am going to get from him about the death of the woman so i changetacks      i ask is it possible to see the coroners report on the death of a childat the spa a little girl named emma i dont know the last name      another customer died at the spa      she wasnt a customer she had apparently been used at the spa forsome reason her youthfulness rubbing off on people maybe im notexactly certain her mother is an uh underprivileged woman      meaning a prostitute i take it how did the childs youthfulness ruboff on people      its a puzzle to me but thats what i was told by the mother dr radictold her that the child died of brain fever while at the spa      she received medical attention before she passed      yes i suppose—      then there wouldnt be a coroners inquiry or any reason for themedical examiner to make an examination because there is a known causeof death certified by a medical doctor      i found it rather strange a child at the spa brain fever—      miss bly you are a newspaper reporter looking for a story the moresensational the better i have to deal with not just the sensational but themundane look around you all of these papers deal with crimes somewith murder most foul if i investigated even one tenth of the deaths of themudlarks on the streets i would spend my entire time at it now if youllexcuse me…      one more question please did hailey mcguire one of our reporterscontact you about the winsworth matter      no      the answer is snapped at me and i snap back are spas like aquavitae so important to the economy of bath that the local officials look theother way rather than probing too deeply into their operations      madam you have overstayed your welcome                                    26i leave the chief inspector knowing little more than when i arrived exceptfor one important fact hailey had not contacted him     i find that strange and mull it over as i slowly make my way back tomy hotel     contacting the police to get as much information as possible is usuallythe beginning and end of a reporters duties in researching a crime storysince hailey considered this story to be very big interviewing othersconcerned would be also be in order but again the police would most oftenbe the starting point to gather as many facts as possible before approachingothers     hailey was an experienced crime reporter in fact almost all of herexperience was hanging around the courthouse talking to policeprosecutors and witnesses     so why didnt she contact the police immediately upon arriving inbath that she didnt was so out of character it left me puzzled     the only other significant information i got from the chief inspectorwas that he isnt convinced that lady winsworths death is suspicious it isout of the realm of possibilities that he would look the other way if thedeath is suspicious—besides ethics and im certain the man has highstandards while spas may be an important source of revenue for the citylord winsworth is rich and powerful for sure he is exercising pressure onthe police and coroner to solve his wifes death     i arrive back at my hotel to freshen up and check for messages before igo for my audience with lady chilcott     the stuffy clerk at the front desk gives me a stiff frown as i approach     a person inquired about you earlier     he left out the word undesirable but his tone implied it     what person inquired about me     a woman of the streets     ah sarah emmas mother terrific did she leave a message     she was asked to leave by the manager the presence of that sort ofwoman in our establishment would create the wrong impression     did she say anything before she was ushered out     she said she would be at the albert bridge trolley stop tonight ateight     is that all     we do not permit—     yes i got that thank you                                     lady chilcotts bath estate is a redbrick georgian manor house withwhite window trim and black shutters i have the cabbie stop at a florist onthe way to purchase a bouquet of flowers as a thank you for seeing meand inviting me to tea its the sort of expenditure that the draconian cashierat the world will refuse to reimburse me for when i submit my expenses      my appointment with her is for two oclock which i know from mytravels around the world on british ships means we will have low tea ratherthan high tea the names arose from the difference between the height ofthe tables and food served low tea also called afternoon tea is oftenserved on a low table like a coffee table in a living room and isaccompanied by cake and the cookies and flat bread the british call biscuitswhile high tea or meat tea is served later in the dining room around fiveto seven with heartier foods such as cold cuts boiled eggs or sandwiches      i am escorted by the butler to the garden where her ladyship is clippingroses while she waits for me      i have never really comprehended the british designation of what thetitle lady means even though oscar has explained it in great detail tome all that seems to stick in my mind is that the womans husband orfather is most likely a knight or nobleman      we sit in comfortably padded wroughtiron lawn chairs as tea andcookies are served on a low glasstopped table      the butler supervises a maid who serves us tea in an exquisite pinkporcelain tea set that has delicate flowers handpainted on it the cups arealmost as small as a doll tea set—so petite are the cups i will have to bevery careful picking mine up out of fear of breaking something thatprobably cost more than my months salary      lady chilcott is about forty years old a bit on the sagging side withtreated blond hair she wears jewelry and brightly colored clothing thatconvey to me a woman who is trying to subtract years from herchronological age by directing attention to things other than her ownfeatures all in all definitely a patient for the spa      i thank her for seeing me and comment about the nice weather theafternoon has brought before we chat a moment about oscar      such a wonderfully irreverent gentleman lady chilcott says hekeeps us all amused by his wit and scandals—unless one is the target of hissharp tongue of course      i dodge the bullet as she tries to pump me about oscars currentdilemma on the grounds im not familiar with the people involved and askher about the spa      marvelous place and anthony—dr lacroix is a genius i understandthat dr radic is as competent but i find his foreign manners less appealingthan anthonys      what does dr lacroix look like      tall a fine figure of a man wellspoken midthirties some womenfind him charming of course the only thing of importance about him is hismedical knowledge      uh huh      frankly she says when it comes to ones health and preservingones vitality dr lacroixs treatments are considered the fountain ofyouth      so ive been told      youve been to the spa      yes      then youre familiar with the peat bog preservation treatment that drlacroix developed      i was under the impression that dr radic had developed thetreatment      dr radic had done work with peat moss at a spa on the continentbefore partnering with dr lacroix here in bath but its peat moss from abog source dr lacroix obtains in dartmoor that is considered the mosteffective in the world i suppose if the foul stuff can preserve a dinosaur fora million years it can help keep us women from prematurely agingwouldnt you say      i join her in a small laugh      you see the painting over there      she indicates a framed oil painting on an easel      thats a painting dr lacroix commissioned the famous dartmoorartist isaac weekes to do of the bog in the moors where he obtains the peatmoss for the treatments at the spa the location of the bog is a secret but hehad the painting done for me in appreciation      she explains that she had the frame repainted because she didnt carefor the color and had it placed on the easel to dry in the sun she doesnt saywhat appreciation meant but im sure it means she gave him money forhis medical research      is dr lacroix from dartmoor      actually my dear i dont think anyone that matters is from that wildisolated place ive been told all of dartmoor is of volcanic origin and onmany tors one can see the awful stabs which are inflicted on the stillunhardened rock by the swords of subterranean fires they say one almostfeels like they have stepped onto the moon scattered throughout arenothing but gorse and blackthorns      gorse      oh its a spiny yellowflowered shrub quite ugly as are theblackthorns nothing like my roses      they are beautiful and i mean it her rose garden is gorgeous—reds pinks whites yellows and the scent they give is heavenly      thank you she says obviously pleased by my admiration of herroses ive won awards anyway where were we … oh yes dr lacroixhe is of french descent on his fathers side but his mother was english andhe was raised here      ive always wanted to visit the moors and see the bogs and tors andsuch      why they are gloomy silent desolate—nothing pretty about themand nothing to do      oh ive heard the moors can be quite beautiful—in a mysteriousunique way do you know what area his bog is in     no my dear i havent the foggiest but oscar said you are doing astory about the spa i would hope it isnt a scandal piece about the ladywinsworth incident     i give her a smile that is meant to reassure her that i wasnt a scandalmonger     im doing a piece on the rejuvenation effects of spa treatments butfrankly its not possible to do without mentioning the incident     your american readers must love tittletattle another young womanasked about the incident     that gives me a jolt hailey … hailey mcguire     yes that might have been the name appeared rather young to be anewspaper reporter—as you do my dear although ive been told youre anaccomplished one though i wont ask why a woman of any age wouldwish to do a mans job     because i like to eat and have a roof over my head would have beenmy caustic reply if i didnt want information from her     hailey spoke to you about the winsworth incident     not to me in particular some other ladies and i were taking a stroll inthe park across the street from the spa early in the evening after ourtreatments and the young woman approached us im afraid her approachwas not as professional as i find yours nor did she come with therecommendation that you have she was rather an excited type much tooanxious for information than any of us wanted to deal with after ourrelaxing therapy so we politely dismissed her thats about all i can tellyou     did she actually ask about the death of lady winsworth     as a matter of fact she did we advised her that any questions shouldbe posed to lord winsworths solicitor     the fact that i now knew hailey came to bath to investigate thewinsworth death made my heart beat like a drum i also realize why haileyapproached the women first rather than the police—early in the eveningmeant that the chief inspector would have most likely left for the day     i sipped tea to calm myself and get my mind on the right path againso uh none of the ladies at the spa are worried about the mineral watersor peat treatment despite whatever effect they might have had on ladywinsworth     you are obviously not well informed lady winsworth wasntreceiving those treatments dr lacroix was giving her his new therapy     which is     i really cant say because its very hushhush dr lacroix hasdeveloped a new course of treatment that is said to be revolutionary interms of revitalizing people     also rejuvenating i ask because im certain lady chilcott and herlady friends are much more interested in taking off years than boosting theirenergy     naturally there are those interested in looking younger but weretold the treatment is in the experimental stage and those who have beenpermitted to partake are sworn to secrecy     i see the blind man says i see nothing except that the spa hassomething new that lady chilcott and her friends are all dying to try—perhaps literally shades of dorian gray oscar hit the nail of middleagedangst right on the head     does the new treatment in any way involve children     children what an absurd notion wherever did you get such anidea     i dont tell her it came from a prostitute i learnt through a source thata child a street child had died of brain fever after being at the spa     miss bly—i certainly hope that you are not insinuating that the staffof the most respectable spa in europe or the ladies and gentlemen whoreceive treatment at the spa some of whom include the most prominentnames in the british empire would harm a child     her lips take a firm set and i realize once again i am up against a wallof resistance and that i have worn out my welcome in asking questionsabout the charming dr lacroix     ill show you out     she gives me a stiff goodbye that sounds more like good riddanceand slams the front door behind me     back in the hansom cab i have waiting i find it strange and fascinatingthe lengths women will go to look younger the money they are willing tospend the lies they are willing to tell the pain they are willing to endure allin the name of looking more beautiful as if beauty is a monopoly of youth      it is a sad state of affairs for women because other than those withinherited wealth there is little for most women to offer the world outsidethe home except beauty and sex appeal because the doors to achievementshave always been closed—which brings up a question about myself      when i mark up as many years as women who drink eviltasting waterand bathe in mud will i join them in the pursuit for a more youthfulappearance      i dont know im sure no one wants to grow old but some obviouslydo it more gracefully than others i just hope i will do it with grace in themeantime i wont throw the first stone at lady chilcott and her friends      too anxious to wait until evening i have the cab take me down streetswhere i will most likely find emmas mother explaining that im lookingfor a prostitute gets me a look from the driver      im with the womens temperance league i tell him      i have no luck locating sarah and return to the hotel emptyhandedhungry and tired                                     27a light mist is falling on this dark moonless night as i leave the hotel for arendezvous on a bridge with a prostitute      while boarding a trolley i remind myself to keep alert—i had beenattacked in broad daylight in london and now i am venturing out in thedark sometimes i wonder if oscar isnt right and i invite trouble because ofthe situations i put myself in perhaps i create the wrong place at thewrong time myself my only justification is someone has to find the truthand this is the only way i know how      meeting with a prostitute on a public street day or night is notsomething i relish although i did worse on the seedy streets of new yorkwhen i went undercover as a prostitute it invites unwanted attention jeersfrom passing men and an invitation for rude vulgar men to sling insultsand dirty language it was the most humiliating and aggravating undercoverassignment i ever undertook13      as the trolley car nears the stop i see clusters of three or four peoplehanging together watching police activity on the far end of the bridge fromthe trolley stop police officers have lowered a rope on a pulley down to theriverbank      getting off the trolley i keep my movements slow dreading the worst      a single gaslight streetlamp takes the edge off the darkness as a bodywrapped in tarp with rope tied around it is hoisted up to the bridge from therocky area next to the river it has the eerie appearance of a ghost risingfrom the water      i cant tell if it is a man or woman in the tarp but my guts knot out offear that it is sarah      what happened i ask three men standing together as they watch thepolice activity      a woman fell off the bridge one said      killed erself offered another      i quickened my step over the bridge and spot chief inspector bradleynear the morgue wagon the body is being loaded into     is the dead woman a prostitute i ask him     he does a double take and looks me up and down as if hes puzzled asto how i suddenly materialized     yes why do you ask     may i see her face id like to know if shes the mother of the girl itold you died of brain fever at the spa     this is police business     i understand that chief inspector im offering to help you identifythe woman     weve had one identification by a man who used her services in thepast he hesitates then takes a deep breath do you know her name     her name is sarah her daughter was emma     once again he eyes me with displeasure in his mind i am a nuisancewho turns simple things complicated whether they need it or not     let her see the womans face he instructs an officer     i take a quick glance shes had a head injury and it bled profuselyive seen blood before but its never uglier than when it comes withviolence     its her sarah     take it away he commands the attendants     well i ask after he ignores me and appears to be leaving are yougoing to investigate the daughters death now     he stops and gives me a long stare as if hes deciding on what tack totake with me i suspect i am getting what he considers to be velvet glovetreatment because i am a woman and inspector abberline of scotland yardasked him to accommodate me     see that man over there     the man he indicates has the disreputable appearance of a saloon thug     thats the womans pimp he says she talked of killing herself allday seems someone gave her a quid and that bought her enough liquidcourage to do the job proper     i take the blow without flinching and walk away but my knees areshaking how dare he i didnt kill the woman or assist her in killingherself life had taken everything from her worth living for when she losther daughter if it hadnt been my money it would have been someoneelses or she would have done herself in without liquid courage      im just about to board the trolley when i spot sarahs pimp talking toanother man under the single gaslight streetlamp      the man he is huddled in conversation with is burke the ruffian with ataste for cowboy boots      a coincidence or had burke arranged the death of sarah because shehad become too loud with her agony      i return to my hotel cold to the bone climb into bed and pull theblankets over my head                                     28go away      i yell at the poor maid when she enters to clean my room i amdefinitely going to have to leave her an extra gratuity for my rudeness theproblem is that i just dont want to get out of bed and face the world i wantto stay with my head buried under the blankets and ignore the hazards andpitfalls of life      i have never been a morning person probably because i have a hardtime getting to sleep at night i believe its because my mind wont let mego to sleep—i keep thinking of all the things i must do and how i mightsolve any problems at hand      last night the death of sarah and loss of her daughter affected me insuch a short time i have listened to a mothers tragic tale of the loss of herchild and seen two corpses that shouldnt have happened      twice in a very short time i have been accused of contributing to thesuicide of another person one of whom was dear to me the other a poorunfortunate for whom i had great empathy and compassion      another thing that kept me tossing and turning was seeing sarahspimp or perhaps more likely the man who simply identified himself as herpimp chatting like old pals with dr radics thug burke did radic haveburke speak to the pimp about keeping sarah quiet about the child washer death the way they silenced her      the plot thickens … but where does it lead      hailey came to bath didnt go to the police but she had arrived toolate to contact the officer in charge of the investigation she went to the spaand tried unsuccessfully to get information from lady chilcott and hersnooty friends      what would she have done then gone inside to the spa yes just as ihad      what happened after that days passed because she returned tolondon and then back to bath      by midmorning my mind is frustrated with all the whos whys andwhats to a puzzle i cannot get a handle on that i willingly get out of bedbut its not enough to make me want to face the world and i mope aroundthe room slowly getting my clothes and my toilet together putzingaround is what my mother calls it      i bathe slowly and dally until the maid timidly taps on my door slowlysticking her head in poor dear is fearful ill chop it off—again      when i smile and convey my apologies along with the extra tip sheopens up and starts chattering away—how relieved she is that im not madat her because shes had other guests blow up at her for no reason and thencomplain to her boss who would take it out of her pay how guests havethrown things at her yelling away and then leaving behind a horrible messif i had stayed i think i would have learnt all the dirty scuttlebutt about theguests and more about her rotten boss too bad i couldnt interview her iknow the hotel maids in america would love to hear how things arent anydifferent in england      thats when it hit me—a likely source for information about haileysvisit to bath would be the hotel      it makes sense i chose this hotel for its location near to the train andbecause its modestly priced reporters travel on what we call beans andnot steaks mr pulitzer and his ilk are not overly generous with expensemoney and im positive hailey would have sought out accommodationsthat would get by the papers cashier without a lecture or a trip to mrcockerills office even when the choice is between a trolley and a taxi thetrolley will almost always win out      now i just need to figure out how to approach the front desk clerk forim pretty certain he wont give me information about another guest unlessi provide him with a good reason      bless the gods for my cunning mind i ingeniously think of one thatim positive will make him eager to assist me      a reporter from my newspaper stayed here recently can you checkher stay and let me know how much you are owed i give him haileysname and the date i believe she was in bath      he eagerly disappears into the adjoining room and comes back with anaccounting sheet      there is no balance she paid for the night she stayed      she stayed only one night thats interesting      quite right one night but you should check at the fontaine she hadher luggage transferred to there      is that the hotel near the aqua vitae spa      yes it is and a bit more pricey than we are      how much more      twice as much for a single      really … did she say why she was leaving      no madam and we offer excellent service for the price      i leave for the fontaine stretching my legs to get my mind going irecall seeing the hotel it looked small and quaint—and pricey and thatpuzzles me why hailey would change from a suitable hotel to one thatwould raise cain with the papers cashier when she returned to new yorkmakes no sense      her trip to bath with the necessity for train fare hotel and mealswould have been questioned unless she had a major story to support theexpenses even i will have to argue to get approval for beans for thisexcursion to bath      pulitzer judges how good a story is by the amount of papers it sells andim still not convinced that the death of a british socialite while beingtreated by a health doctor would generate enough appeal for new yorkreaders to support extraordinary efforts and expenses      the fontaine clerk is also eager to check the accounting register to seeif hailey left owing any money      she didnt pay the bill herself but her twonight stay was paid theclerk tells me      really my editor was under the impression it hadnt been paid      well… he looks at his books its understandable he would be underthe impression she didnt because it was fully satisfied by the spa when itarranged for the room      the spa … yes i see aqua vitae arranged for the room      yes madam they do that quite frequently for their spa patients      we were also wondering about her luggage      im actually wondering where she went from the hotel—obviouslyback to london but i want to make sure because it strikes me that itspossible hailey checked out of the hotel the very day she died inspectorabberline told me that the exact day of death couldnt be determinedbecause of the state of the body so there is a range of several days ratherthan pinpointing one      youll have to speak to the porter      he taps the bell on the counter and an elderly man in a blue portersuniform comes forward      i explain to him that i am tracing luggage that left the hotel for thetrain station and give him the date and a description of hailey      yes i remember her we dont get many americans and almost nevera young woman traveling alone she requested her luggage be sent to thestation but were not responsible for the luggage after it reaches the trainstation      did she happen to mention which train she was taking      no madam i never spoke to her i was just told to take the luggage tothe station westbound      which city      could be bristol madam or all the way down to exeter indevonshire      devonshire… i glance at a railroad map on the wall behind the frontcounter is that where the moors are      yes madam exeter is in the dartmoor area      did you uh happen to speak to miss mcguire at the station      no madam i merely delivered the luggage to the baggage room as isaid the hotel is not responsible for lost luggage you should speak to thehead porter at the station if you wish to file a claim      one last thing i give him a crown coin did you see miss mcguirewhen she checked in      yes      what was her mood      her mood      how did she appear to you sad happy      she was a very nice woman very polite perhaps a bit more livelythan the young women i usually encounter      what do mean by lively      bubbly madam smiling laughed easily full of life      an apt description of hailey my head is buzzing when i leave thehotel trying to make sense of what i have learnt      hailey probably spent most of her last day here in bath then shewould have returned to london depressed and killed herself but if shereturned to london which is east of bath why would she instruct herluggage be sent to the westbound platform      the bellman also confirmed what both the boardinghouse maid andjames the gatekeeper had said—she wasnt sad or depressed      i realize i dont know which direction hailey went because no one ivespoken to actually saw her at the train station no one took the orderdirectly from her as to where her luggage was to be sent      so where did she go back to london without her luggage or westwith her luggage      logically my next move should be to return to london and adviseinspector abberline of my findings and ask him to check further into thematter i would then board a ship for the return trip across the pond      logically … of course but i have no intention of doing that instead ireturn to my hotel      may i have a porter get me a ticket to exeter while i get together mythings to check out i ask the concierge      of course madam is there anything else we can do for you      no that shall do oh are there any telegrams for me      he looks in the slot for my room here you are      its a telegram from oscar my dear nellie its getting quite warm ifnot hot in dear old london im thinking of leaving hows your questgoing      i immediately respond back off to find the fountain of youth in amud hole in dartmoor next stop exeter why dont you join me we canbe partners in crime just like the old days      that done i go to my room pack my valise and freshen up for my tripwestbound i havent the foggiest idea what direction hailey went when sheleft the fontaine hotel but i am fairly certain that for some reason herluggage went west—perhaps as far southwest as the gateway to the moors      the same moors where dr lacroix gets his magic mud                                    29i love a journey and am usually up early and head out with vigor today myfeet are dragging because i am unsure of whether i am doing the right thinghaileys body was found in london yet i am setting out in the oppositedirection without any good reason other than i suspect her luggage went inthat direction      why would anyone want her luggage for the same reason her officewas cleaned out papers burned and her room at the boardinghousesearched she had come into possession of something probably informationshe had written down that someone wanted destroyed      up to now i have been concentrating on her lover as the culprit but drradic and his cutthroat enforcer are crowding the field of suspects radic isa highclass polished crook but of the most dangerous variety—the fact heemploys a man like burke shows that he is not above cracking heads to getwhat he wants      and the elusive dr lacroix—where does he fit into the puzzlepartnered with radic and linked to the death of the little girl emma and thehighsociety woman makes him a likely candidate for any number of highcrimes in my mind      at the station i speak to a porter who is assisting westboundpassengers with their luggage he wasnt on duty that day but suggests italk to the baggage master in the baggage room since the train will bedeparting shortly i leave my valise with him and go to inquire at thebaggage room      i dont recall a young american woman the baggage master tellsme but unless she spoke to me how would i know she had a colonialaccent      good point he smirks at referring to americans as colonials iveheard it before      as i swing back around to return to the train before it leaves withoutme i spot a familiar figure—the blueeyed young man on the london tobath train who had stared at me so rudely and took an unhealthy interest inmy luggage and only spoke german      he hands a coin to the porter and heads to board the train he musthave considerable luggage because he is carrying a valise larger than mineand doesnt leave it with the porter i assume the gratuity is presented forluggage handling      i retrieve my bag and am about to board when i see someone else iknow and exclaim its old homes week      well i hope whatever that means its an indication you are pleased tosee me mrs lambert the widow who protected my valise on the londonbath train beams at me      very pleased but surprised can you imagine—i just saw the manthat had been eyeing my luggage on the train from london board this one      you dont say what a coincidence but you know my dear they saythat the steam engine has shrunk the world      having raced around the world in seventytwo days on steamdrivenships and locomotives thats an observation i wouldnt contest but as yousay—what a coincidence      she explains that she finished her visit with her sister in bath and isonto exeter to see another sister      unfortunately we might find the train a bit crowded til bristolwhere most people will get off mrs lambert says after bristol theroute south all the way to exeter is a slow milk run because there are manysmall places and no big towns along the way      once aboard we discover shes correct the only seats available are inthe open day coach and only a few are left i insist she take the first one wespot to ensure she wont end up standing      but what about you mrs lambert proclaims i so wanted us to sittogether im dying to find out how your investigating is going      i see another empty seat down the aisle and tell her ill take it well iguess well have to wait til after bristol to chat      in some ways im glad we wont be sitting together as much as ienjoy talking with her i need time alone to get my thoughts organized andplan what i am going to do next formulated in my head i find a seat quite afew rows farther down next to an older gentleman who is completelyengrossed in his newspaper     as i lift my valise to place it in the overhead luggage net i notice afolded sheet of paper that has been slipped into a side pocket i rarely usebecause my bag is usually packed so tight i cant get anything thicker than ahairpin into it     i pull it out and after im settled into my seat i unfold it     its a pencil drawing—a humorous sketch of a man sitting at a tablewith pencil and paper watching a woman with a valise walking away fromhim she appears to be hurrying away     the woman is me the man is the individual who had an unhealthyinterest in my luggage     scribbled below the caricatures is ive learned anglish                                     30now i know why the man tipped the train porter—he had the porter slip hiscaricature in my valise obviously he has given up whatever pretense hehas been operating under and wants to meet with me why because thereis no way i would consider his presence on the train as a coincidence afterhe showed an interest in my luggage and he must know that the womanwho chased him away reported his attempt to me      he has blue eyes so did the man who tried to get into haileys roomand who i assumed was her lover      well we will see about this i tell the older gentleman next to me asi set out to find the man who has been playing games with me      the caricature and his pretense at speaking only german also show hehas a sense of humor but im not amused      as i pass by mrs lambert it occurs to me that i might invite her alongfor my confrontation with the mystery man but decide against it instead igive her a pleasant smile at her inquiring look i dont feel the need to shareany more information and already regret that i shared a few tidbits aboutmy quest with her because i usually find it bad luck to talk about a storyim investigating especially to strangers no matter how kind they are—youcant trust anyone im ashamed to admit that i was drawn in by her beingso in awe about me being a female reporter and she was just plain kind so ilet my guard down      normally i keep matters close to my chest—that is how i havesurvived years in a dogeatdog atmosphere of reporting i will never forgetthe best piece of advice i received from my first boss mr madden at thepittsburg dispatch if you believe you have a lead to a headline story keepit under wraps like a treasure map—dont show nor tell anyone      well mrs lambert is just a sweet widowed lady so no harm has beendone      i should have little to fear from the man physically because the train iscrowded besides this man didnt appear on the surface at least to be thetype to resort to physical action unlike the thug who mugged me in broaddaylight on a london street or burke at the spa the drawer of the comicpicture is smaller built and as mrs lambert put it appeared pretty muchlike a counter jumper—a clerk in a retail store however i sensed ascholarly air about him      he strikes me more as the type who would slice one to ribbons withpen and paper than with a knife then again i once interviewed a quietscrivener a copyist for an accountant who killed three people with an ax      whoever this man is why he is following me and why he has nowmade contact with me are matters i cant fathom except that he has aninterest in this matter and very well could be haileys lover      also puzzling is why he has chosen such a circumspect way ofcontacting me simply walking up to me and introducing himself wouldhave done the trick but instead he started out sneaky and even tried to geta peek at my valise—probably for the diary he didnt manage to find inhaileys room for certain he wants me to contact him and has chosen arather unusual way to communicate his desire      miffed and puzzled at the same time i must admit im excited for ourmeeting one way or another i am certain that somehow in some way hehas a connection to hailey there cant be any other explanation for himcontacting me      i have to wonder—did his tip also allow him a peek into my valiseback at the bath station not that it would matter unless he had anunhealthy interest in female garments      the notion that he is the man hailey was romantically involved withgets cemented into my thoughts as i go through the train to find him hesnot unpleasant to look upon and has an air about him that conveys a certainintelligence—a quality in a man that is appealing at least for me i have noidea what are the qualities in a man that attracted hailey      two cars down is where i find him hes at a writing table engrossedin making entries in a journal and has an unlit pipe clenched in his teeth      he looks up not completely surprised to see me      im not amused by you or your antics i tell him      i dont blame you sometimes i dont like me much myself but imsaddled with me      selfimmolation is not an excuse for rudeness or spying on me youhave some explaining to do before i call the conductor and have him takecharge of you so you can be turned over to the police at the next stop     he takes the pipe out of his mouth and gives me a long appraisinglook i can see why you are a success in your career you give no quarterhe gestures at the seat across from him please join me perhaps i can offersome extenuating circumstances before you have me arrested for whatevercrimes you believe ive committed     someplace where people can breathe the smoking car is my leastfavorite place on a train and i refuse to sit here with him and talk     he puts his writing materials in his carrying case and follows me westop in the gangway between the cars the window on the door is openallowing in breathable air along with the sound of wheel over rails     explain yourself i snap     we need to start with a change of attitude on your part i dont takewell to bullying even if it comes from an attractive young woman     an unexpected answer but one i can deal with fine if youd rathernot talk to me youll be doing your talking to the police     for what drawing a picture is that a crime in your country     in my country this country and all civilized countries i have been inthe police frown on strange men stalking a woman well see how thebristol police deal with a man who has been giving uninvited attention to awoman     i turn to leave and whip back around when he says wait     you have exactly one minute to convince me not to have theconductor take you into custody and turn you over to the police at the nextstop     you are a humdinger miss bly but dont push it youre not going tosay anything to the police     im not is that what your crystal ball tells you perhaps youd like toshare with me your vast knowledge of my thought processes     because it would delay you you are trying to find dr lacroix beforetime money or the demands of your job cut off the search he pauses andlocks eyes with me i am also looking for him maybe we can join forcesh g wellsi have come to believe in certain other things in the coherency and purpose in the worldand in the greatness of human destiny worlds may freeze and suns may perish but ibelieve there stirs something within us now that can never die again                                                                        —h g wells                                      31he sticks out his hand to shake an unusual gesture by a man to a womanbut one that sets well with me i shake hands giving him a tight grip myinstinct is that i can trust this man and ill feel better about my gut reactionif he comes clean and tells me truthfully what he has to do with hailey      h g wells my friends call me h g      sounds like the chairman of the board what do your non friends callyou      we agree on wells i tell him he can call me bly but we agree uponnellie when he says that sounds too formal      so much fencing just to come up with names to call each other i sensethis sort of verbal dueling is a foreshadowing of our future discussions      im a teacher he says      fine youre a book learner who teaches others how to learn frombooks now tell me what your relationship was with hailey      i had no relationship with miss mcguire never had the pleasure ofmeeting her though i heard she was a very fine young woman      i stare at him with exasperation it is clear that information doesntpour from him if you didnt know hailey why did you try to get access toher things why are you following me across england and trying to snoopin my luggage why are we having this conversation      he shakes his head with wonder was your mother a gatling gunhe quickly holds up his hands to warn off my attack i apologize this ishard on me actually that is a dumb statement its obviously much harderon you because you lost your friend i was trying to get information aboutdr lacroix      why      he owes me money for research i conducted for him      i am not comfortable with his answer though im not certain if its anoutright lie or an embellishment of the truth running to different towns andgetting on and off trains are hardly the way a debt is collected     wouldnt it be easier to lay a claim in court with his spa it looks likea place where mud is turned into gold     its—its not just the money he took something else from mevaluable information from my research its personal and id really rathernot go into it but he owes me and i expect to collect     why have you been following me     i read up about you he grins and shrugs you are known forfinding and uncovering things people want hidden dr lacroix is hidingim certain he is and not on the continent     why are you sure he hasnt left the country     because im certain he set up a laboratory in the devonshire areahes been quite secretive about it but i became aware that he was shippingequipment and supplies to exeter very complex items not the sort of thingyou duplicate at two places or in some cases duplicate at all he shakeshis head no im certain that he is somewhere around exeter which isone of the reasons i continue to follow you you must have found a lead toexeter what is it     i ignore the question for the moment how did you know i have beentrying to locate dr lacroix my statement isnt exactly true—i have beentrying to unravel haileys last days and the trail has simply set me uponlacroixs own path     james anderson     who is…     the front desk attendant at the international news building he was aclassmate of mine     that little rat james had been holding back on me okay … but inever told james anything about dr lacroix     i know you spoke to him about the reporter that killed herself thatsoriginally why james contacted me she was going to do a story about thespa james said she was fascinated by the subject of rejuvenation shebelieved women back in new york would be excited about the research     my heart skips a beat you spoke to hailey     no we never were able to get together james conveyed her wish tomeet and talk about the subject but id had complications from an injuryand was indisposed at the time     he did appear to be a bit pale      by the time i felt better she…      yes why did you pretend to be her brother what did you expect tofind in her room      ah you know about that im embarrassed to admit i was playingdetective i knew she had made trips to bath and i hoped she might have alead that id find in her notes as you know the ruse didnt work that mrsfranklin is one meanspirited woman      is that why you searched haileys office and burned papers a shotin the dark but im certain its a good one and i know ive hit the mark byhis attempt to suppress a grin      guilty of going through her office not of burning any papers i sent atelegram to miss mcguire after i felt better and got back a reply that shedcontact me upon her return from bath after james told me she had takenher own life i got him to let me take a peek in her office      what did you find      nothing about bath i took nothing out with me and certainly neverburned anything      did you see burned materials in the wastebasket      they could have been there but i didnt notice them if they werewhat i saw appeared to be years of accumulation of news stories i assumedthat there was no current notes because she kept them with her what doyou think was burned      what i think is that im not going to give information to him until ihave more answers      so why didnt you simply approach me if you thought i was seekingthe same information that you are      ive heard that youre a lone wolf you work completely alone andare not in the habit of sharing information      that analysis of my methods is from my friend hailey to james toyou      yes though i did do a bit of reading about you what would you havedone if i had contacted you in london from what ive learned you wouldhave picked me clean of what i know and gave me nothing like you aredoing right now      its my turn to smother a grin hes right im wringing him dry ofinformation and have told him nothing     how did you find out i was going to bath i never told james     i was waiting in your hotel lobby arguing with myself as to whether ishould approach you when you went into the telegram kiosk and sent offtwo     that was you with your head buried in a newspaper     once again guilty anyway i used an old schoolboy trick to read oneof your messages—pretending to write out a message myself i took theblank pad of sheets you used and rubbed my lead over the imprint yourpencil left on the top sheet     good lord and you accuse me of being a secret operator you couldgo to work for your government as a spy     why thank you he smiles broadly i have taken quite a fancy tothis detective work i must say the procedures are not unlike chemicalexperiments you keep trying different things until something works     i dont bother asking him how he traced me to the westbound trainthe clerk and porter at my hotel knew i was taking this train     i turn and look at the passing scenery to get my thoughts organized heis an intelligent man but in terms of what it takes to deal with violence andcriminals he is a babe in the woods hes a book learner and dealing withthe likes of radic and burke takes skills that are learned on the street—where i learned them thats where my guts got honed to deal withundesirables—sometimes by having my face rubbed in the dirt     bottom line we see the world in two radically different lights andwould be at odds at almost everything if i let him come along with me     are you an artist i ask in reference to his comic doodling     not at all though i write a bit articles on science     it is easy to see from his clothes that neither his teaching nor hiswriting has brought him much financial reward he dresses respectfully butmodestly—not unlike a counter jumper     it is time to brush him off well … i must say i am very impressedwith your efforts at getting information very much so     but not enough to share information with—or team up with me     he doesnt pose the remark as a question he has already decided uponan answer     i smile demurely ill give some thought to that     he chortles at my vague and evasive response well i suppose ideserve that for permitting you to crossexamine me turning me upsidedown and shaking all of the thoughts out of my brain however ill respectyour decision but do watch yourself with that other reporter     what other reporter     why your mrs lambert of course like the cheshire cat in lewiscarrolls alices adventures in wonderland he gives me a triumphant grinyou are aware im sure that she works for the most contemptuousnewspaper in the entire empire a gossipmonger that prints anything but thetruth     a chuckle starts deep in his belly and rumbles like distant thunder ashe delivers yet another blow but of course a smart woman like you knewyou were being had—didnt you                                      32i make a quick check with the conductor about train schedules out of bristolbefore returning to the car that holds mrs lambert and my valise      mrs lambert…      yes dear… she looks up from her crocheting is everything allright      well … not quite could you join me at the back of the train car weshould take our belongings with us      why of course my dear      the train is just pulling into bristol as she packs up her stuff and i grabmy valise      im afraid i wont be going on with you to exeter i tell her in aconfidential tone ill be leaving the train here in bristol      really that man you spoke with the one i kept from getting intoyour luggage must have told you something i hope hes not tricking you iknow you cant confide in me but ive come to think of you as a sister asa woman i am proud of you and your accomplishments why what littleyouve told me simply thrills me      well… i glance around to give the affect that im making sure noone is listening and tell her in a confidential tone i must have your wordof honor that you wont speak a word to anyone      of course my dear my lips are sealed      ive learned something from an absolutely reliable source butremember you must keep this a secret      yes yes…      that doctor i told you im investigating—ive learnt that he isnt inexeter but is staying at a manor house outside of worcester      no are you certain      absolutely the man i spoke to was there and he spoke to him theproblem is the moment this train stops in bristol i have to make a mad dashfor the northbound worcester train itll be leaving almost at the same timewe arrive ill have to buy a ticket on board no time to waste      we hug and i promise to write her already having exchangedaddresses during our previous trip together      i shall not forget this little journey weve had together she says aswe are pulling to a halt and i get ready to disembark and run for the train onthe opposite set of tracks you dont know what you have done for me—adding excitement into my drab little life thank you my dear      i wont forget you i say as i dash off and i doubt youll be thankingme later what a con artist i could kick myself for falling for her wordsnever again      youll be hearing from me she yells      i seriously doubt that      as i go up the steps and onto the northbound train—and down thesteps out the other side—i move quickly to get out of sight      once both the northbound and southbound trains clear the station icome out of hiding and make my way to the ticket office      excuse me sir      behind an open wooden booth a ticket officer looks up from a mess ofpaperwork he takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes yes miss what cani do for you      i hand him my ticket is this still valid to exeter      he puts his glasses back on yes it is      when will the next train be arriving      in an hour      thank you can you recommend a café for lunch      theres one across from the station foods good tell mary i sentyou      as i enter a waitress approaches me your gentleman is waiting overthere      excuse me      she points to h g wells who grins and waves from where hessitting      i take a deep breath and stand perfectly still for a moment      he obviously is not as gullible as the scandal press reporter i still needinformation about dr lacroix from him so i might as well give up theghost in terms of getting rid of him and join him for tea and clotteddevonshire cream with scones     with my best smile i approach him     wells i have to admit that you are as hard to get rid of as poison ivyand just about as welcome     nellie you will not regret your gracious invitation to have me joinyou in this quest i will always be there for you     thats what im afraid of                                    33on the train en route to exeter i am in an aisle seat facing wells next tohim is a man engrossed in a newspaper the seat next to me is empty     i remind myself to make the best of the situation wells outsmartedme but the game is not over yet and i do find his comments about thesituation keen     earlier over lunch after i told him about my growing suspicion thathailey had discovered something about the death of lady winsworth andhad been killed to keep her silent he made a salient point dr lacroix isvery much a ladies man     thats the main reason radic wanted him as a partner radic is ashady businessman with all the charm of a viper but lacroix attractssociety women there are rumors that he was having an affair with ladywinsworth     i had already presumed that he was romancing rich women for theirmoney     that might be true but if it is it wouldnt be for personal gain theman is a true fanatic when it comes to his research i understand he putsevery dollar into it and i dont doubt that some of the money comes fromolder women who are captivated by his attention lacroix had a societymedical practice before he went into partnership with radic and created thespa but dont confuse the knowledge of the two radic claims to be alicensed doctor in romania but hes not one here which makes me doubthis claim few people doubt that lacroix is a brilliant doctor and scientistbut almost everyone in the medical profession and scientific communityrejects his hypothesis     which is     lacroix is trying to find a way for the human body to rejuvenate     to get younger     a universal dream of man since eve grew old and adam startedlooking around for someone younger and prettier      but found his male virility had gone the same place as eves lovelyskin i counter im certain that every search for the fountain of youth hasbeen based upon fraud and humbug      your comments are the same as almost any medical man in londonbut few people understand—or even care to understand—what lacroixmeans by rejuvenation it was even a standing joke at the college where hetaught students and faculty called him dr ponce and referred to his class asbimini which was the mythical island where ponce de leon thought hedfind the fountain of youth      but dr lacroix isnt advocating some hokum about turning back theclock making a fortyyearold twenty again—reversing the biological clockthat takes us from infants with perfect skin and organs to ripe old age withwrinkles and wornout hearts and lungs instead he is selective focusing onskin just as a womans jar of cold cream can delay or even get rid ofwrinkles he is seeking a natural substance that will revitalize the skin      sounds more like alchemy than science dont alchemists search forsome sort of universal remedy called a philosophers stone      in matter of speaking some alchemists seek a substance capable oftransmuting common metals into gold others an elixir of life that canreverse or stop aging but you have to appreciate that their fruitless questsfor things today we call magic created a great deal of scientific knowledgeand the scientific method used by modern researchers      you did research on this rejuvenation theory im curious wellsdoesnt strike me as someone who would be involved in fraud or hogwashso i am very interested as to what he actually did for dr ponce      i did research on salamanders      salamanders those lizards that live in water      theyre not actually lizards even though they look like them asalamander has some rather interesting characteristics it can lose a leg orother body parts and regenerate them but its not the only creature that cando it some worms shellfish and insects also have this ability we humanscan do it in a very limited way—when our bodies form scar tissue overwounds its regenerating flesh      have you found out why salamanders can regrow an arm and a leg      no lady winsworths death put a halt to the research      the scandal and all      not just the scandal—she was financing the research      oh i see by putting up the money she got first claim on a new arm orleg or face or— i shut up because the look on his face is not pleasant iknow im being catty but it really sounds like a lot of bunk to me      he leaves without a word and i glance over at the man wondering whathe thought of the conversation he is crunched up in the corner next to thewindow asleep behind his newspaper his hat pulled down over his eyes      i wait patiently for wells to return … well im not sure if thats trueeven though i have always considered myself a patient person no one elsei know would agree with me when i am forced to sit still i have a habit ofshaking one of my legs sometimes tapping it against something that causesothers to ask why im kicking the object and i have been accused manytimes of being afraid of silence because when a conversation dies down itend to pick it up again      my other fault one my dear mother says i have is my dire need tomake amends that is i react badly to any sort of rejection so instead ofsitting with my foot nervously shaking i get up to find mr wells andsoothe over whatever feelings i have inadvertently ruffled      this is why i dont care to work with a partner—i dont want to dealwith the baggage that comes with working closely with someone else ifrequently find myself having to tiptoe around the other person becausethey are not keeping up or want to go in a different direction than me or ihave in some way offended them and have to soothe the waters and in thenewspaper business a partner almost always means a man and they saywomen are moody      i find wells in the gangway between cars leaning on the wall next tothe door the top half of the door is open and he is letting the wind soothehim      im sorry i tell him i didnt mean to belittle your work with thatstatement i am being honest      you are a very intelligent woman nellie more importantly youknow how to think i admire that      the compliment catches me by surprise and i dont know how torespond      most women he continues even those with intelligence spendtheir lives in a dark intellectual closet trained from infancy to let the manin their life first their father then their husband do their thinking forthem      i suppose because my father died when i was a child and my mothernever recovered from the loss of him i didnt have anyone else to do mythinking      that may be but even though you have a quick mind and areintelligent you also rely almost entirely upon your instincts and evaluationsof people rather than information derived from research or analysis      the man certainly knows how to turn a compliment into a lecture andpersonality assassination      may i ask how you derived at this brilliant assessment      listening to you you have learned everything you know by talking topeople you talked to your friend oscar in london a prostituteeavesdropped at the spa—      thats how you get information when doing a criminal investigationcriminals dont write their actions down in a book for us to peruse talkingwith people is the only recourse i have and that puts me miles ahead of youand your book learning reporters are not teachers and bookworms wework in the real world      i leave steaming the gall of him      once again i find myself in the same quandary about mr herbertgeorge wells as i did when i first caught him surreptitiously observing mei am attracted to him but i dont appreciate him dissecting me like i am oneof those lizards he cuts legs off of to see if the limb grows back      i end up in the dining car and order tea to soothe my irritation i knowwhy it hit me so hard—because its true i dont have as much education asother newspaper people and rely upon my instincts—very successfullythank you      wells is suddenly standing next to me      my apologies      he sits down across from me i give him a blank stare his commentshave no meaning to me i decide im not going to let him affect meanymore i hate emotions that drain precious energy from me      i was being analytical to a ridiculous extent your method of relyingon your gut and going straight for the jugular has made you renowned inyour profession      fair enough i set down my tea and i will admit that a little booklearning never hurts anyone—until it gets in the way of real life i dontknow anything about salamanders but i did notice a little while ago youtook offense when i made a remark about lady winsworth is that becauseshe supported the research you and dr lacroix conducted my suspicionis that it goes beyond financial support for wells but i start with a bit ofcircumspection to throw him off guard—then ill go for the jugular      lady winsworth wasnt just a benefactor of lacroixs she wasextremely kind to me i didnt know the man before she began supportinghis research she introduced us and encouraged him to permit me toconduct the research despite the fact i dont have the advanced degree inchemistry that he desired in a researcher my degree is in teaching ratherthan pure science but her sponsorship was satisfactory enough to get methe work especially at a time when i was in desperate need of it      in other words lady winsworth controlled the purse strings andwould have pulled them tight if lacroix had not accepted her candidate forsure lacroix wasnt going to bite the hand that fed him i still get the hintof deeper currents ones wells keeps concealed recognizing a notrespassing sign i keep smothering my natural intention to hit him with thebig question      your gratitude toward her is the reason you are searching forlacroix      his eyes meet mine and i see smoldering anger i want to know whathe gave her      so you do believe that some potion he gave her killed her      i dont know what else to believe she was a healthy woman of fortyfive her one fault if i can call it that was that she didnt want to lose herbeauty she didnt realize that the more mature she became the morebeautiful she truly was she would have taken any treatment he gave her      even an unproved or untested one      that is what im thinking—that he gave her a potion beforethoroughly testing it lacroix is a risk taker hes a mountain climber andhas ascended the deadly matterhorn wells gives an appraising look howmuch do you know about him      hes a society doctor attractive to women and uses unorthodoxtreatments and somewhat sounds like what wed call a snake oil salesmanback home oh—and his partner is a jerk i lean across the table and lockeyes with him and i dont need a textbook to tell me that       i havent met radic but will take your word for it however youshould know that lacroix is a hematologist       i smother a groan im sure ive heard the word but i cant rememberexactly what it means which is       a blood disease specialist its a small but respectable medicalspecialty its not a popular area of practice for most doctors because solittle is known about diseases of the blood lacroix was originally more of amedical researcher than a practicing physician extremely bright heobtained a university teaching position despite his frenchsounding nameand middleclass background       he was not a popular teacher because he was exceptionallydemanding ive been told that he expected his students not only to betireless in repeating experiments but to reach further with their researchgoals than others had gone       he sounds a bit like dr pasteur who also was completely engrossedin his work       you met dr pasteur       from the tone of his voice i can see that puts me up a notch in hisevaluation of me       yes i met him in paris i cant brag any more than that because thenit would bring up the questions why and how and ive been sworn tosecrecy14 and from what ive learned pasteurs feet and mind are onmuch firmer ground than lacroixs       im sure youre right but lacroixs academic downfall wasnt fromhis teaching methods or his unorthodox research methods but from hisneed for blood you cant examine blood diseases most of which are stillundefined as to cause without blood doctors proved reluctant to permithim to get out his lancet and cupping glass to draw blood from their sickpatients in order to do his research a bit shortsighted by the doctors sincecures will never be found if research isnt conducted but certainly not onthe patients to whom the loss of blood might prove fatal       many people use leeches to draw what they believe is bad blood iinterject     yes but leeches drink little and only the bad blood also the leechesdont cause the infections and sometimes death occurs when doctors gofrom patient to patient slicing veins and using cupping to suck out blood     hmm … its just like the controversy between dr pasteur and themedical profession he claims that doctors are killing their patients by notwashing their hands and instruments as they go from patient to patientthey wont listen to him because they claim since he is just a chemist andnot a doctor he doesnt really know what he is talking about did you knowthey wont even let him administer a rabies shot to a patient even though hediscovered it because hes not a doctor     no i didnt but in regards to doctors killing patients i tend to agreewith him     so how did dr lacroix solve his need for blood     grave robbing for a while at least a mild variety of it he hiredmorgue and mortuary attendants to drain blood from corpses for himunfortunately a church deacon found out hed had his dead wife drainedand brought the police and the church down on his head—hard takingblood from bodies wasnt a good scientific approach anyway becauseexcept in a few cases he couldnt tell what the person died of had he beenbetter connected socially or at least less arrogant and singleminded abouthis work he might have survived the crisis with a reprimand     i have fleeting sympathy for anthony lacroix having been told thatmy aggressive reporting has made me more enemies than friends i believethat some people will show up at my funeral not to pay respects but toreassure themselves that i am really dead     what happened to him     he was ordered by the medical board not to conduct any moreresearch using human blood disobeying the order will result in the loss ofhis medical license when he left the university he really wasnt fit for thequiet life of a blood doctor—operating in the dark when handling patientsbecause no one really knows the cause and cure of most diseases thenprescribing remedies that often seem to cause more harm than good this iswhere radic came into the picture     he recognized dr lacroixs work with rejuvenation as amoneymaker rather than a scientific breakthrough i offer     quite and i suspect that lacroix teamed up with radic more to getmoney to carry on his research than just to make money     how do you figure into the equation     after he teamed up with radic and offered his peat moss rejuvenationprocess at the spa a remedy he has been experimenting with while atuniversity he went back into research with rejuvenation this time financedby lady winsworth     does he do any experiments with children i ask     not that i know of why     did you ever come into contact with a woman named sarah in bathshe was a prostitute and mother of a child named emma     he shakes his head and i tell him about the woman and her child     that makes no sense but ive never even been in the spa heappears genuinely puzzled let me assure you i experiment onsalamanders not children     he stands up and in a gentlemans way takes my arm lets return toour seats and ill tell you about the black beast     what black beast     the one we have to be on the lookout for if we are going into themoors                             the black beast of the moorsstanding over hugo and plucking at his throat there stood a foul thing a great blackbeast shaped like a hound yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has restedupon and even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of hugo baskerville onwhich as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them the three shrieked withfear and rode for dear life still screaming across the moor                     —sir arthur conan doyle the hound of the baskervilles                                     34we return to our seats with me eager to hear about the legendary creatureof the moors tell me about the black beast      you shouldnt be so eager not everyone who encountered it lived totell the tale      my being ripped to pieces by a savage beast would sell newspapersback home pleasing my publisher to no end      a worthy tribute to you im afraid my death would only burden myfamily with brief mourning and unpleasant funeral expenses as for thestory there are places in the world where so many unusual things havehappened that they achieved a reputation for the strange and unexplainedthe moors of dartmoor is one of those places perhaps its because thelandscape itself is so alien to most places on earth—its part of england yetone gets the feeling that theyve left civilization behind when they enter      most of the time its wet misty black silent and desolate the hillsare topped with rocky outcrops and bogs lurk as concealed death traps thetors are raging chaos materialized and petrified to people who dont livethere the moors are considered a savage beast      why are the bogs so dangerous cant you just walk around them      you may not know theyre underfoot especially in dim light or atnight the bogs commonly have a thin green coating on top that looksrather like the rest of the terrain the scientific term is sphagnum mossyoull be walking on wet ground that seems spongy and quakes a bit underyour feet and not realize youre on a bog until it swallows you up thatsprobably why they call them featherbeds or quakers      it sounds like quicksand you wouldnt recognize it until you startsinking because it looks like sandy ground objects like leaves and smallbranches can lay on it because theyre light and wont sink and that givesyou a false notion its solid      quite but most people have a misconception of quicksand becauseof the density of quicksand its unlikely an animal or person will becompletely devoured by it as long as they dont fight it the key is toremain calm and slowly work your way out of the muck but with a bogonce you sink into it unless someone is around to help pull you out youmay not be able to escape its really quite scary and deadly      this happen often      its not an uncommon fate for the sheep and small dartmoor horsesthat make up most of the living creatures in the moors england is denselypopulated yet dartmoor is a wilderness so the human footprint is smallits fitting that in this strange twisted landscape of the moors there arelegends of the mysterious and even the macabre they are known forhaving more unexplained deaths than any place in england ive heardpeople call it the moorland tragedies besides the bogs there is also themist      the mist how can mist be dangerous      because it is thicker than the london fog these mists are so thickthat everything around them is concealed from view and a person can be indanger of losing themselves entirely the mists will suddenly arise and putevery object in so impenetrable a shroud that unless one is well acquaintedwith the area its impossible to find a way out even the locals get misledby the strange appearance that even familiar objects take on when they aredistorted by the mist      probably walked into a bog      dont joke it happens      why dont they use a compass or a map      dartmoor is a trackless waste a compass might help but you need toknow where youre going i read about a woman who went out to milk thecow at six in the evening as she does every night when a mist quicklyenveloped her she was a short distance from her house just a mile or twobut wandered in the moors until four oclock in the morning when shereached home drenched and soaked to the skin now one last tale about themarshes do you believe in ghosts      im not closed to the idea of spirits but ill fully embrace the notionwhen i see one      well you might encounter one or more in dartmoor its said theyhave more ghosts than people however i fear the people mistake a naturalphenomenon that occasionally appears over the marshes for ghosts itscalled a willothe wisp or ignis fatuus—latin for foolish fire      in america we call them jackolanterns they are seen at night ortwilight over swamps and marshes but i guess in your dartmoor it wouldbe over the bogs it looks like a flickering lamp suspended just over thewater and seems to recede if you move toward it or follows you if youmove away from it very eerie no one knows what causes it but as kidswe always said it was a ghost trying to lure you      when i was a kid we called the flashes of fire corpse candles whatcauses it are gases rising from the decaying vegetation in marshes and bogswhen phosphine and methane produced by organic decay come in contactwith the oxygen in the air it ignites but its just one of the many amazingaspects about the region that you will find challenging      i dont feel daunted by what wells is describing modesty keeps mefrom mentioning that dartmoor is postagestamp size as is england itselfcompared to the vast american west much of which is trackless desert orimpassible mountains not only have i crossed the west by train andstagecoach and spent six months traveling in rough and wild mexico15 ihave traveled around the world and seen many things that are strange anddangerous but the chance of being sucked into the earth by a bog doessound ominous—what am i getting myself into      what about the black beast i have a feeling that there is somethingmore to wellss ghost stories than idle chatter and want to get to the bottomline      wells smiles patience nellie i am getting there the most famoustale about the moors is that a doglike creature comes out at night to killdragging the bodies to a bog where they sink after it ravages them thishuge beast is said to be the ghost of a powerful landowner a squire wholost his soul in a deal with the devil at night people have claimed to hearthe wistful cry of the beast they say its howling sweeps over the moorslike a thousands wolves wailing to a full moon most importantly lacroixbelieves in the black beast      what you are joking      it isnt a theory he goes around uttering in public we worked veryhard for several long days and in a rare moment of companionship we ateshepherds pie and downed a few pints at a pub he told me that he waspleased with my work—despite my lack of education in the field      he made a point of that i take it      quite typical of him his lack of diplomacy aside he said after imfinished with the salamander study he wanted me to do some experimentswith his peat moss treatment attempting to isolate exactly what is in themoss that acts as a preservative for human flesh during the conversationhe brought up the tale of the black beast of the moors he believes that moststories like this have to have some basis in fact to them because theyvehung around over centuries dragons are an example for thousands ofyears people believed that the bones of giant creatures occasionally dug upwere dragons it turns out they are dinosaur bones but that doesnt changethe fact that giant animals some winged like dragons existed      dragons are what the fairy tales might call them but there wereflying dinosaurs—pterodactyls      im impressed      i just smile and nod my head it gives me great pleasure to showwomen have knowledge in other fields like science and not just cleaningcooking and sewing its knowledge i picked up helping a fellow reporterwith a story but that still counts      but technically wells says pterodactyls are flying reptiles theydid exist during the dinosaur age and thats why most laymen think theyredinosaurs but they arent      touché please continue but if he thinks ill forget he called me alayman hell be surprised      lacroix believes that the black beast did exist and perhaps may stillbe around his theory is that a primordial beast was so well preserved by apeat moss bog that it even retained the spark of life      and occasionally waddles out of the muck to eat someone wells iam having a difficult time connecting lacroixs bog bogyman with ourinvestigation      its quite simple lacroix doesnt take peat moss from just any bog inthe moors—      i got it oh my god he claims hes getting it from the same bog thathas preserved the beast over the millenniums so if we find the bog wherehe gets his magic mud well find lacroix      vampires      the word drops like a sack of cement between us it doesnt comefrom wells but from the man who has been crunched up next to thewindow sleeping—or so i thought      the man gets up from his seat and addresses us forget the blackbeasts mates look for the blood and youll find the vampires      he gets his luggage out of the net above and steps by us the train iscoming to a halt in exeter      wells leans toward me after the man walks off      dont be upset hes just a rude buffoon      im not upset by his little joke or whatever prompted that remark itssomething else      wells raises his eyebrows what you look like youve seen a ghost      i have … or a version of one the suits new the collar fresh theshoes shiny and i didnt get a good look at him but id swear that that manis the same mugger who grabbed my purse and stole haileys diary from itin london                                     35arent you taking this a bit too far wells addresses me as i move my feetas fast as i can to get us from the train to a cab we have a perfect hotel tostay in right here by the rail station      no this town eseter—      exeter      that too is too convenient for that man from london to keep an eyeon me if youd like to stay please be my guest im going to an inn anyinn far out on the outskirts      my lady where you go i go he tips his hat and gives me a sarcasticgrin      i ignore him as we board a cab the air is nippy as night falls and darkclouds flow in off the cold waters of the english channel i wish we couldhave stayed exeter looks like an interesting town the river exe windingthrough gives it a shakespearian feel but i cant take any chances      youre going to miss seeing some of the most beautiful cathedrals inthe world      excuse me im sorry my mind is on that man      understandable youre sure its the same man      yes he might change his clothes but he cant change that faceexcuse me i yell up to our driver can you pull over to your right      he stops on a quiet street      we arent being followed wells whispers dryly with a deadpanface not unless were being spied upon by an aeronaut in a balloonhidden in the clouds above      satisfied we are not being followed i tap the roof you can proceed      the cab moves forward taking us away from exeter and hopefully toan isolated inn on the outskirts of town      is this how you spend your time wells asks dashing here andthere spying and being spied upon      its a living      are there any more openings                                      here we are the driver announces as he brings the cab to a stop bogriders inn and pub the farthest one out of town as the lady requested hejumps down and helps me out       welcome the innkeeper is tall and sinewy with coarse swarthyfeatures his hair is very black and curly tied carelessly behind his neckwith a narrow black ribbon he has a dimple on his chin that is veryprominent when he smiles my mother claims dimples are a sign ofintelligence       one room or two       two… comes from wells and me       im pleased but i have to admit a bit of silly woman feelings emerge—does he not find me attractive inwardly i scold myself for being sofoolish       first time here he asks us as he turns the register over for us to sign       yes this time it only comes from me       word of advice dont go walking out by yourself and especially atnight we have bogs that are treacherous if not deadly thats how we gotour name a man walking across the moors one night didnt realize he wason the firmappearing top layer of a bog he saw a hat on the ground andgave it a kick a voice from below asked him why hed kicked his hat offthe puzzled man asked if someone was in the bog and the man belowreplied just me and the horse that im sitting on       the innkeeper howls with laughter over his tale and wells joins him itake it the story is a local favorite to tell visitors       watch where you put your feet appears to be the message i tellwells after we settle into a table in a corner of the room       the place is crowded with locals mostly men we both order toad inthe hole which is sausages in a yorkshire pudding served with mashedpotatoes and onion gravy wells orders a pint of ale       i guess theres no chance of them having champagne i imbibe verylittle but when i do i enjoy champagne tonight i could use its nervecalming effect       here no now if we had stayed in town at that hotel irecommended…      do i sense someones a little miffed      quite the contrary im fine staying here in this small quaint pub onthe edge of the wilderness of tors and bogs and crags its you who iswanting champagne and i was just pointing out…      yes yes i get the message but its better safe than happy      nellie its better safe than sorry      that too but right now i would be happy having a glass ofchampagne ive been unsettled ever since i saw that man and its notbecause im in fear of the man himself—though i have to admit afteralready experiencing his handiwork as a mugger i do appreciate the factthat he is a man who can be dangerous but right now its more because ofhis cryptic remark      yes that was quite odd making a remark about vampires but ibelieve he was just being obnoxious and facetious      thats interesting coming from someone who talks about darkbeasts      he starts to object but i continue and it was look for the blood andyoull find the vampires anyway i dont believe it was a coincidence thathe was on that train—im certain he is following me not that its thatdifficult—i left a clear trail for an army to follow one thing ive learned asa reporter—what looks like a coincidence usually has crafty hands behindit      even vampires      you think he was joking being obnoxious but i dont take it thatway i dont believe he was giving a warning either im sure he wouldntcare if i was eaten by a moor beast or had my blood drained by a vampire      so what does your gut tell you about his motives      my gut thank you tells me that the man has a big ego and he wasboasting he knows something we dont and couldnt resist taunting usand for the life of me i cant figure out what he was alluding to      understandable because there is nothing behind it he was jokingpulling your leg as my father would say and he has succeeded      i dont believe it he was being facetious for sure but i still believehis choice of words has meaning      wells gives his head a shake and shrugs perhaps he said his remarkbecause lacroix is a blood doctor who once paid for blood i told youabout the ponce de leon jokes      what if dr lacroix has gone back to experimenting with bloodcould that be the reason the man made the crack      maybe but hed lose his license if he obtained blood illegally      no risk is too great for a person obsessed with seeking power wealthand fame but i suppose the most important question is not the significanceof what he said but who is he more importantly my gut tells me hes ahired hand not a principal someone has hired him to follow me and idlike to know why      im afraid i didnt pay much attention to him seemed like a prettyordinary chap dont you think maybe a traveling salesman      or a copper      you think hes a police officer wells looks surprised why wouldyou think that      had much dealing with the police      frankly … none at all that was of any consequence      ive had a lot almost always very good … though once in a whileive had to deal with a rotten one and when a cops bad watch out hesgot a gun and a nightstick and likes using both      so you think hes a police officer      an excopper id say hes cut out of the same rawboned mold thatmost of the coppers i know are long arms to throw a punch big knuckleswhen it connects long feet for a kick and his shoes they are the heavyshoes good for walking on sidewalks that help the aching feet of flatfoots      he raises his eyebrows i didnt realize bobbies were so uniform      its attitude too in a small town you always knew who was going togrow up to be a police officer it was the toughest boy who liked orderingpeople around      and why do you think hes an excopper      when i saw him in london his suit and shoes were worn the kind ofwear you get from not having a wife to take care of them and no money forthe laundry no police captain would permit an officer to show up for dutylooking grubby no i think hes been a police officer and ran afoul of thelaw himself he fell from grace and into the gutter he was paid to get thatdiary from me and from the looks of him its obviously increased hisfortunes      amazing i dont know what to say what else do you have up yoursleeve about this fellow      mr wells i sense a bit of sarcasm in your voice      perhaps jealousy would be a better description of my attitude iapologize its just that its rare to hear a woman be so analytical or a manfor that matter im quite impressed please continue      another notion about the man has been brewing in my head and ishare it it is possible that he didnt follow me to bath what if somethingin the diary sent him to bath i tell him about finding the bath ticket in thediary      but if he didnt follow you to bath how did he happen to end up inexeter      he could have easily learned my destination i made no secret about itat the hotel or there could have been something in the diary that directedhim to bath and exeter hailey might have been jotting thoughts in thediary about her investigation of the spa      does your analysis hint at who hired him      that is the question isnt it      we sit on the question for a moment while wells downs the rest of hispint and orders another      i would venture a guess he says that it was radic and lacroix whohired him to get the diary      perhaps      ah nellie that perhaps was very vague      my instant reaction would be a yes as to the spa snake oil doctors buthis comment about vampires throws me off it has to have something to dowith lacroix and i dont see the man flaunting the connection of the manwho pays him      we silently mull over the puzzle for a moment before i share anotherthought with him      im bothered by the notion that hailey would have put informationabout the story she was doing on the spa in her diary a diary is kept forpersonal matters knowing hailey that diary would bare her innermostfeelings it doesnt add up any more than hailey spending several days inbath much of it at an expensive hotel at the expense of the spa      ive told you dr lacroix is quite a ladies man faced with a threatfrom a female reporter his reaction would have been to charm her wellspours a small glass of ale from his pint and pushes it across to me its notchampagne but it does wet the whistle      im not crazy about beer because of my stepfather but i dont want tobe rude so i take it      thank you ale must be an acquired taste because i find it ratherbitter hailey was extremely impressionable and immature when it came todealing with men mostly no doubt caused by her lack of experience andlack of training from parents because she was orphaned ive seen her getgiddy around men who flatter and flirt with her      wells strokes his chin and nods so she may well have put things inher diary about dr lacroix after he turned his charm on her and in doingthat she could have included information about the spa what she sawheard even perhaps information about a laboratory in the moors      quite i say with a smile being british for a moment      which means lacroix and company would have a very good reasonto want to get their hands on the diary      i agree but we are leaving out another fine candidate      which is      lord winsworth i understand hes a tough twofisted ragstorichestype owns mines one of the other things ive learned about coppers is thatthe man who mugged me also matches the modus operandi of the type ofman hired by mine owners as strike breakers if winsworth is that toughits hard to imagine him letting a society doctor get away with killing hiswife without exacting a bit of revenge      you should have been a lawyer wells smiles of course youre thewrong sex he leans forward and meets my eye that is both acompliment for you and an observation about the unfair way women aretreated in society      vain as always i blush with pleasure down to my toes      lets get back to vampires i tell him                                    36the vampyre wells says and frankenstein were written by a pair offriends at the same haunted time and place the two books of horror cameabout in 1816 due to a cool wet summer in what historians now call theyear without a summer     yes i remember that … well my mother told me stories that werepassed down from her own mother the weather turned very strange sheepfroze in meadows flocks of small birds were found dead in the fieldspennsylvania got snow in june crops were ruined and prices went way upnot to mention so many deaths especially with the elderly and very young     what my mother thought was interesting were peoplesinterpretations on why it happened priests were supposedly saying it wasgods way of punishing them for their sins and the sins of others anothertheory for it was benjamin franklins lightning rod experiments—somepeople believe he affected something in the air that changed the weather     yes stories like that were passed around all because of ignorance alack of knowledge my fathers favorite was a merchant ship was foundunder full sail with nobody aboard scientifically the cold damp summerhappened because of a series of severe climate abnormalities caused byenormous volcanic eruptions unfortunately as you said a great number ofpeople starved that year including many in northern europe but out ofevery catastrophe something good arises from it     in this case a group of very talented young people including the poetsshelley and lord byron were staying together at a manor house inswitzerland stuck indoors because of the awful weather they beganreading ghost stories and then challenged each other to write their ownshelleys eighteenyearold girlfriend and future wife mary created thefrankenstein monster and their friend john polidori a doctor produced thefamous vampire book in three days     amazing     quite i must confess i am fascinated with this type of fantasticwriting and the stories are among my favorites as it happens in thevampyre spelled with a y lord ruthven a mysterious stranger appears inlondon where he seduces society women a young man becomes intriguedby him and travels on the continent with him the young man eventuallydiscovers that every woman lord ruthven seduces ends tragically heinvestigates lord ruthven but his own life is lost after his love is killed andhe fails to save his sister from the vampire      good lord what a horrible story      wells laughs it depends upon your tastes certainly not a goodchoice for someone who likes a happy ending i love a good tale of gothichorror whats your preference      a good mystery my favorite right now is the new sherlock holmesmysteries      why does that not surprise me wells smiles maybe you shouldtry your hand at one      i did i wrote the mystery of central park which was published lastyear in october after i went undercover as a prostitute i decided to write amystery it just seemed fitting and the whole setting of central park isperfect for such a tale      miss nellie bly you are full of surprises a reporter and writer imdeeply impressed you went undercover as a prostitute his eyes twinkle      yes but i remained a lady      never doubted it      our food comes and we eat in a silence a quiet moment im enjoyingdespite the fact that i most often feel the need to chatter away to fill thevoid      once our plates are cleared wells leans forward and whispers with aglint in his eye so what do you think nellie is dr lacroix a vampire      why not perhaps the excopper or whatever he is was speakingmetaphorically hes a blood doctor who seduces wealthy women eitherphysically or with promises of eternal youth      i dont think that quite fits the definition      he is also a stealer of blood at least in the past that certainly placeshim in the vampire category as far as im concerned      he gives a smile that is almost quizzical      what i ask      i was just thinking that i am hiding out from a copper turned badwhile sitting in a pub talking to a mysterious foreign woman about murderand monsters there are two amazing things about that the first is that ihave a tremendous imagination which leads me not infrequently to stormingcastles and rescuing fair princesses all without leaving my teacherspodium and the second is that i am talking to a woman about theseincredible subjects      i can assure you wells that if mary shelley or my friend sarahbernhardt were here they would conjure up more fantastic ideas than i evercould i put my elbows on the table and lean forward it is decision time      so mr h g wells you do agree with me that dr lacroix is amodern vampire type      he sits up straight adjusts his tie and noisly clears his throat in aword miss bly … no      i suck in a deep breath please tell me why      i rather suspect that dr lacroix is a victim of mad science orperhaps science gone mad is a more accurate assessment      what are you talking about      nellie think about the age of scientific discovery the world is in forthousands of years literally since the beginning of recorded time the worldhad changed little in terms of technology then during a few decades of ourown time we got the telephone the telegraph electric lights the steamengine and a thousand other innovations      dr pasteur in paris is finding whole new worlds under a microscopea man named bentz in germany is building a carriage driven by a gasolineengine aeronauts are soaring in the heavens with dirigibles and hotairballoons they even say we will have flying machines during our lifetimes      what are you saying that dr lacroix is just another scientifictrailblazer like pasteur and edison      no dear nellie the fact is that there is another side to science a darkside you know about frankenstein are you also familiar with the strangecase of dr jekyll and mr hyde by robert louis stevenson      yes a little a doctor makes a potion drinks it then goes aroundkilling people      quite do you see the similarites between victor frankenstein andjekyll and dr lacroix      im in a fog      let me explain what jekyll and frankenstein did was venturebeyond the realms of rational science in their experiments unlike pasteurwho is moving slowly taking one step at a time building on one smallfinding and then another until theres a mountain frankenstein jekyll andlacroix all have the same method—to attempt in one giant leap to create ina test tube matters that are in the hands of the gods      do you see the logic and even simplicity of their methods victorfrankenstein believed he could inject electricity into the body of a deadperson and ignite life back into the body jekyll thought he could controlhuman nature with a concoction because substances like opium can affectbehavior and lacroix believes he can reverse the aging process with whatyou call his magic mud because preserved bodies have been found in peatmoss      wells they are madmen—dr jekyll victor frankenstein besidesarent you forgetting something … they are fictional characters      no i havent but what you have obviously forgotten is that whatmany authors have written about have come true or inspired inventionscase in point jules verne and his many literary inventions that have comeabout they completely accepted science as their god and set out to createmiracles instead what they created turned against them and when it did itfirst broke their spirit and then their minds      you think science has driven dr lacroix crazy      i wouldnt doubt it remember this was a successful universityprofessor who instead of conducting himself in the way customary of menin his profession threw all caution aside crossed moral lines and broke thelaw to get the blood he needed for his experiments      i mull over that for a moment you believe thats what happened tolady winsworth that lacroix once again was the risk taker a man willingto cross the line and try something radical regardless of the consequences      yes that is my take on him working with him experiencing hisfanatical nature his obsession with results when conducting experiments ifelt i was dealing with a man possessed      stop i tell him my head is swirling all this mad science is drivingme crazy ive dealt with more insanity in the last hour than i did spendingten days in a madhouse      he reaches over and takes my hand in his      my apologies darling nellie but i have one more question to raise      my heads splitting but go ahead though i may run screaming out ofthis pub      he leans forward and speaks in a confidential tone lovely nelliewill you make love with me tonighti was never a great amorist though i have loved several people very deeply                                                                       —h g wells                                    37i almost knock over my chair as i leave him at the table and march to myroom he is lucky that i didnt slap him in the face right there and have theinnkeeper evict him what nerve what a cad and i believed the man to bea gentleman      nellie—i must explain      i swing around to find him running down the corridor toward me      you have said quite enough i turn back to the door to my room imso angry i fumble trying to get the key into the lock      please let me explain      i take a deep breath and face him i suggest you retire to your roomand sleep off whatever disgusting thoughts the alcohol has created in yourmind we will discuss in the morning our arrangements      please you must understand i fell under your spell      oh boy that was a showstopper with me but its only a brief momentbefore my insecurities step in under my spell as a woman of beauty andcharm do give me some credit for intelligence i look in the mirror eachmorning and im well aware that i am not a helen whose beauty launched athousand ships      i was referring to your mind your spirit your wonderfully rationalattitude      oh oh damn—only my mind is beautiful      you are a complete woman ive met only a few of them in my life itis much more attractive than the external beauty society gives suchimportance to i misunderstood i thought because you had freed yourself ofso many of the straightjackets the world puts on women on all of us thatyou had a broader more worldly attitude about lovemaking      i stare at him befuddled      he appears to be completely remorseful i dont know what to say orthink im not a prude i have been in a mans arms before held a man inmy own i am well aware that the best reason not to be promiscuous ispregnancy—like hailey i have no one to turn to if i become pregnant isupport and love my dear mother as she does me but she would bedevastated if i was with child without a husband especially when i am hersole means of support     i know there are ways none of them surefire to avoid pregnancy but iam definitely a conventional woman when it comes to a relationship with aman—which is why i found wellss comment offensive     i hesitate to ask wells but what exactly is your uh worldly attitudetoward lovemaking     he takes a deep breath and relaxes just a little pulling his kerchief outof his breast pocket he pats his forehead     i must confess that i was caught up both by the moment and the alethe moment being my admiration and amazement at meeting a woman witha free spirit     yes youve mentioned that now tell me about your moral attitude     my moral attitude … well i guess you could say that my way ofthinking is that men and women are free to do what they care to do as longas they dont hurt others it strikes me that most of the laws and customs inregard to whom when and where sex is to be conducted come from churchpeople who either dont have sex dont enjoy sex or dont know how toenjoy sex and hate to see others enjoying it     are you married     no but let me assure you that when i am married my attitude willnot change if a man and a woman are attracted to each other a tinywedding band shouldnt be enough of a barrier to keep them from enjoyingeach others bodies to keep them from touching and kissing and caressingand—     go to bed     he stares at me     go to your room and get some sleep and dont ever speak to meagain with such lewdness or i will have you arrested and this is not aminister speaking its me a lady                                     sleep is impossible i lay in bed angry at myself    i am not angry at my behavior with wells he had been impertinent      and it is not what i said that makes me angry      it is my weakness that has me tossing and turning my mind swirlingwith sinful thoughts      h g wells is a brilliant man that i have come to realize and there isanother side to him a side of passion and sensuality he is a man hungry forlove and i am a lonely woman who at times like this could use the arms ofa man      i am too young to be a spinster but sometimes thats how i feel mostwomen my age are married and have children i have stuck to work mynose to the grindstone my love and attention have been directed solely onthe wrongs i have investigated the stories i wrote my desire in life is tohelp change the world—only unlike the red virgin the fiery frenchfeminist and revolutionary who presses her demands for social change inthe streets my pen is my sword      i am a working woman in a mans world      that means sacrifices lots of sacrifices ive had to put everythingaside except my dedication to my job i have to be faster and smarter thanthe men around me to survive because few of them believe a woman shouldbe doing their job      it irks me no end that i cant vote i cant sit on a jury and that manystates curtail the property rights of women that women are barred frommost jobs and paid less than what a man receives even if they do the samejob and forget about being promoted—that never happens but i try not tothink about those injustices because if i did i would never get anythingdone and as silly as this sounds i hate that men can wear pants andwomen cant id like to see men ride a horse sidesaddle wearing a dress      i dont know about the afterlife i have not a clue as to what i will findin heaven or hell or whether ill get sent anywhere after ive given up theghost but i do know that i have one chance to go around one chance to doexciting things one chance to accomplish the impossible and to climbmountains only men have been permitted to scale      and i am not going to pass it up because i am by societys terms awoman      i can already see the writing on my tombstone here lies nellie blywho was hungry for love but too afraid to experience it because itwould have kept her from climbing mountains                                     38the next day we had an unspoken truce between us and we went along as ifnothing had happened we had to return to exeter in an attempt to locate theartist while there i sent off a telegram to oscar asking him if he had everheard of any connection between dr lacroix and the hounds of the moors      i am certain that most of the gossip in london society passes byoscar wilde at some point i tell wells      ive never heard of the gentleman      oscar would be mortified if he heard that he wrote a book you mightfind interesting the picture of dorian gray as a matter of fact oscarbelieves dr lacroix got some of his ideas about eternal youth from hisbook      interesting … i must take a peek at it when i return to london      we have no luck at the post office locating the artist and go into a shopthat sells painting and art supplies      i inquire of the proprietor whether he knows a painter named isaacweekes and get a positive response      yes yes weekes is noted for his dartmoor scenes i have severalhere let me show you      he takes us to three paintings each of which is a broad picturesqueview of the moorlands its rolling hills and tors topped with explodinggranite crags      im looking for a particular painting … its of a bog i tell the man      im sorry i dont have one i can query weekes about preparing oneit would take a few months to obtain knowing weekes does what hewants when he wants the store owner laughs and throws up his hands      are you familiar with a weekes painting of a bog it wascommissioned by a friend of ours a dr lacroix      no im sorry i have no knowledge of such a piece or your friendweekes doesnt display all of his artwork here he has the majority of hispaintings displayed in london more money there      do you know where mr weekes lives this time the questioncomes from wells      yes in a small dartmoor village called linleighonthemoors aboutten miles west of here youd have to rent a pony cart to get there      perhaps a taxi i suggest      wont find one to take you out there road is too rough for a regularcarriage i wouldnt even call it a road most of the way its more for sheepand goats the stable will rent you a cart that can do it better get an earlystart in the mornin though to return before dark i dont recall the villagehaving comfortable accommodations though the pub might have a room ortwo                                      poor quiet and remote wells says later after consulting a map at therail station the sort of small village where people raise sheep grow theirown food and there probably hasnt been a new house built since thenorman conquest the only daunting thing is there is only a dirt road to thevillage a common trait to most of the small villages scattered arounddartmoor by dirt road i am of course referring to what the art galleryproprietor called a goat path      at the telegraph office we find a reply from my missive to oscar      he says that the expert on hell hounds is the author arthur conandoyle the man who writes about the detective called sherlock holmes hesays that doyle is in dartmoor at present      i read the sign of the four excerpts in the strand wells says anexcellent mystery tale from what youve said about your friend oscarwilde detective stories would not exactly be his cup of tea      theyve met because they have the same publisher anyway he saysdoyle is in a place called buckfastleigh researching a book      buckfastleigh is about twentyfive miles or so from here wellslooks at his pocket watch i believe we can get there by train by noon ifwe go now so we better get to the station if thats your plan      any chance the train can drop us near the village artist      no its in a different direction and its already too late to get out andbe certain we can make it back to exeter before dark      well just have to chance it if we meet up with a black beast of ahound i shall simply tell it that its not permitted to eat an american      at the stable i soon discover the difference between a carriage cab anda pony cart is comfort the buggy has two tall thin wheels but no springsso we will feel every rock and rut on the road the seat is an unpaddedboard and backboard which means after a few miles i will be very soreand the pony is a runt much smaller than what we would call a pony backhome though i wouldnt call him that because hes very cute and lookssensitive the buggy wheels are taller than the little critter      i pull wells out of the ponys hearing we cant have the poor littleguy pull us that would be cruel      dont let his size fool you its a dartmoor pony they are strong andhave stamina and this one is lucky to be pulling a cart under sun and starscruel is what happens to his fellow ponies these small ponies have beenused in tin mining and at the granite quarries here in dartmoor since beforethe romans unfortunately because of their small size theyre also used inunderground mines to haul ore carts once theyre down there they neversee the sun again and are even buried in the mine to avoid the expense ofbringing them out      thats horrible they should have the mine owners pulling the cartsand leaving them down there      the cart has to be back tonight the stableman tells us needed formilk delivery at five in the morning he removes two big tin milk pailsfrom the storage rack behind the seat and then gives us a narrow lookyoure not going to make it out and back before dark im going to need anextra deposit to cover a broken wheel or pony leg      id pull the cart myself before id let the pony break a leg i tell him      off we go but not at a speed that would impress the owners ofkentucky derby runners and true to my previous experiences with buggiesthat lack springs i feel every bump on the road      after hearing so many stories about the eerie moors bogs thatswallow people and black beasts that run them to the ground and rip outtheir throats i confess to wells between bumps that i do wish well beable to get to the village in decent time talk to the artist and return toexeter before dark     might not be a problem with this guy taking us he assures mepointing out how effortlessly the pony appears to be pulling the buggy onthe cobblestone street he grins but well have to see how bad the goatpath is                             dartmoor ponies     have you visited dartmoor often     this will be the first time but i have studied the geology of the areaas part of my teachers training     uh huh book learning                                      39the road changes from cobblestone paved to just paved then packed dirtand finally to paved with boulders and ruts     as we trudge along at a slow but steady pace the hours pass and weleave behind all the remnants of mankinds footprint except for the narrowpath the landscape transforms from city to rural and finally to wilderness     now i can understand why moorlands are not just described simply aswilderness as the mountains forests and deserts of my own country arebut seem to have their own category with the moors there are also shapesand images that are strange to my eye—mysterious and preternatural evenfear evoking     craggy wildshaped tors with winding tumbling rivulets and greenfields that wells from his book knowledge assures me are not the mosscovered bogs the quakingearth variety that suck you down never to befound again     no wonder this scarcely populated land off the beaten track hasgenerated so many tales of ghosts and ghouls that are stranger than fiction     my imagination starts to go wild and i can imagine a dinosaur peekingits head out from one of the granite mounds or druid priests conducting asacrifice on a moonless night within the confines of a stone circle     despite his estimate that we might be able to conduct our business atthe village and return to the city before nightfall it is obvious to me that wewill be lucky to reach the village while the sun still shines     anything out there dangerous other than the bogs and ghosts youveread about in a textbook petty but i cant resist the jab     he gives the landscape a look as if hes scanning it i dont know …might be a viper or two     poisonous     yes but the snakes tend to mind their own business unless someoneprovokes them     wonderful my experience with snakes is that they tend to feelprovoked when you accidentally step on them     a light mist is falling and haze is gathering in the distance blurring thelandscape making it even eerier     we should have waited and set out at the crack of dawn i complain     quite my fault for not relying upon my instincts and letting youmake the decision     i made the decision because i have more experience than you have     been to dartmoor often he asks     dont be snide ive been to the wild west mr wells—and im sureyour black beast offers little danger compared to dealing with boozedupcowboys and miners shooting up a town and each other our snakes wouldmake vipers run so fast theyd shed their skins     this time i get a long appraising look from him     why are you staring at me i ask     i was thinking how different—pleasantly different—it is being in thehands of a woman instead of just in her arms     let me assure you that if a great black hound comes galloping at usyou will have to run very fast to be anywhere near my hands ah butagain vain as i am i waddle in the compliment but dont ignore the factthat he has made a reference to romance do you spend much time in thearms of women     not as much as id like not having a title money or a handsomemug i must reply upon a womans charitable disposition     we share a laugh at his selfdebasement that is interrupted by one ofour wheels rolling in and out of a large rut i am so sore i feel as if id beenpaddled on my seat     linleighonthemoors is set in a flat area where a narrow river comesout of a rocky gorge and spreads out barns and small granary towers arevisible outside the village as we top a hill and come down to the ruralcommunity it is still daylight but less than an hour of it is left     grazing sheep a few ponies and a few lonely farmhouses are the onlysigns of life weve seen much of the way but as we come into town we seea large number of carts in the center of the town square and even a fullsized horse almost all clustered around the alehouse     probably market day wells says since the roads are rough ornonexistent and the terrain unruly im sure the village gets visitors onlywhen its absolutely necessary some of the dartmoor villages are soisolated theyve developed dialects that are different than the kings speechand almost impossible to understand even for brits like me      wonderful if i had difficulty understanding the people in exeter andhes saying hes going to have a hard time understanding the people in thisrather isolated town im in a pickle—as my mother would say      the houses are built of stones gathered from the moors with thecracks closed with mortar they are gray darkened by time but appearstrong enough to withstand any storm that mother nature sends roaring infrom the sea most have a porch facing south and granite mullionedwindows a general store an alehouse and a small church—probably just achapel because i see no residence for a minister—comprise the mostprominent buildings in the village square      i think the general store will be our best place to find where isaacweekes lives wells says      fine you can do all the talking      finally he says      in linleigh i add      i just smile and gladly get out of our cart      youll find him at the alehouse or hell be there soon the proprietortells us      steady customer wells asks      every day but sunday and hed be there on the sabbath if the placewas open old isaac goes out with his painters kit and stays out in thefields the whole day rain or shine painting and doesnt come back intotown until the last bit of light is leaving and the alehouse has opened itsdoor for business he enjoys a pint or two before going home to face thedickens      the dickens comes from me      thats isaacs wife a woman with a sharp tongue and a broom shesgenerous at using the hard end of that broom against man or beast orwhoever else gets in her way old isaac is just the opposite living up to hisbiblical name as a man of laughter      is something special happening today i ask so much for wellsdoing the talking      market day but i do say its unusual to get so many strangers in towngot a man on a fullsize horse dont see many of those around here nextthing you know well be getting the horse with the iron hoof      the horse with the iron hoof is—      a steam locomotive i finish wellss attempt to explain to me as weleave the store thats similar to the same name indians use to describe atrain out west but small chance theyll be seeing an iron horse in theseparts during our lifetimes unless they discover gold      the alehouse is dark with a blackbeamed ceiling low enough for aman to reach up and touch crowded with small tables and large peoplenoisy and smoky the small amount of breathable air is saturated by theheavy perfume of stale malted beer      wells asks the barmaid about isaac weekes      bellied up there she jerks her head in the direction of the short bar      would you tell weekes wed like to buy him a drink i hand her acoin      there is no room at the bar and no empty tables but at the sight ofhard money from out of towners she quickly orders three men up fromtheir table and has us take it i tell her we are buying the men their nextdrink and i get grins of approval from them a moment later shes backwith the artist      weekes is a rather diminutive gentleman pintsized id say probablynot much taller than his wifes broom slender and small boned he has athick mop of black hair thick black eyebrows gray eyes and blackeyelashes that any woman would envy the wrinkles around his eyes form adelicate network woven from gazing great distances for his paintingsruddy cheeks hold the deeper laugh lines while on brow and neck are thedeep imprints of sun snow rain frost wind—natures markings      he could use some of dr lacroixs magic mud his age is hard for meto guess because i cant tell if he is an old man with young features or ayoung man that appears older than his chronological age my impression isbetween forty to sixty but i could be off decades especially since thestorekeeper called him old isaac      we introduce ourselves as lovers of the moorlands and interested in apainting of one of the famous dartmoor bogs i tell him mentioning thatour friend dr lacroix referred us      ah good dr lacroix a gentleman he is and a fine one at that     he offers a toast to lacroix he and wells with ale me with applecider the artist does appear to be jolly but i suspect some of it comes fromwhat he drank before we got there     the place is so crowded we have to lean over the table to be heard andwe are brushed by others standing close by as they move about     after he gets another pint he salutes us with the mug then takes a longswig and smacks his lips yes dr lacroix is a fine gentleman in factanother friend referred by him been askin about his bog painting     i try to act nonchalant at the startling statement but im sure my faceregistered surprise who asked i mean it may be a mutual friend     never got his name big man from london id say though i neverasked and he never offered to tell where hes from     new suit new bowler hat i question     might yes id say his clothes looked new but then again i dontknow much about the clothes worn in london this gent a friend of yours     actually no hes not more of what youd call a competitor i have aconfession to make were newspaper reporters doing a story about drlacroix and the miracles hes creating with his peat moss treatments     he told me youd be coming     who told you we were coming i glance at wells puzzled heshrugs his shoulders     dr lacroix when he had me do the painting he said id get visitorssomeday who would want to know where the bog is that fills his need saidpeople would want to know in order to steal his secret thats why he cameto me and didnt hire a local artist to do the painting he paid me well tokeep my mouth shut and im good at that even after ive had a few     i always find it interesting to find out how far into his cups a man hasto get before the demon rum loosens his tongue just enough for me to getany information i need from him     have another mr weekes i say     dont mind if i do     neither do i i signal for another pint for him     you mention that there was a local artist that was at…     the question remains hanging as the man reflects on something     he paid me well dr lacroix weekes says but it almost cost memy life ive seen plenty of strange things out in moors but it was the firsttime i saw the ghost of lady howard with her coach of bones pulled by ablack beast of a hound he gives us a glassyeyed stare near scared thelife from me      he coughs out spittle and stares at me i dont know what to say hiseyes turn glassy and his face goes beet red my impression is that hessuddenly holding his breath      are you all right wells asks      weekes stares ahead and then coughs again blood dribbles down thecorner of his mouth      my god i think hes having a stroke i look to wells what do wedo      weekes gives out a gasp that sounds like a nervous rattle from hislungs and then seems to simply relax in his chair dead      i cant breathe      i stare at him then look at wells who stares back at me his mouth isopen and so is mine      weekes slumps forward      the handle of an ice pick is sticking out of his back      theres a scream      mine                            a dartmoor road                                     40everything stopped the talk the laugher the slap of ale pints ontotabletops the loud sucking noise some men made as they slurped down thebeer for me time itself stopped in a frozen moment during which i gape atweekes the last remains of weekes      then all hell broke loose as the realization dawns that there is death—that there is murder—before their eyes      my entire world is a small crowded smoky little pub in a wildernessvillage that is probably too small to be on most maps first there is moreconfusion than questions—my god it cant be what happened howwhy who did such a thing      when the last question makes its way around the room like a juicyrumor whispered at a party the room grows silent and two dozen pairs ofeyes stare at the two strangers in the room      wells and i look at each other we dont need a ouija board to realizethat we are the only candidates for murderers in the room      you killed him a grizzled man with the body of a blacksmith says tous      the strangers killed old isaac another man yells      murderers the barmaid screams      a growl goes around the room and panic moves my feet and mouth      i step up to the barmaid stop it i spin around to the tightly packedcrowd surrounding us look at us were not killers we were talking toisaac about a painting someone killed him but not us we hardly know theman      no man in linleighonthemoors would have touched old isaaconly a stranger could have done it if not you lady then him      more growls of concord go around the room poor wells is wideeyedhe tries to say something and it comes out as a stammer      wait i shout we were facing mr weekes hes been stabbed frombehind      another frozen moment as the men digest what i told them i hearmumblings of assent and others of doubt      wheres the other stranger i ask      theres confused mumbling and the man who accused wells saysthere are no other strangers      there has to be the man at the general store said there was i pounceat the barmaid you served another stranger in here tonight didnt you      yes by the lord yes i did she looks around he was here amoment ago whered he go      there was a man standing behind isaac earlier wells says      yes i gave him a pint the barmaid says      thats your murderer i tell the men find him      wells and i pour out of the alehouse with the others      the horse is gone someone yells      the statement is about the fullsized horse wed seen earlier as themen gather to talk i pull wells away and to our buggy      as we leave town i tell wells keep the speed down      why they may think about it and come after us      i look back there is no pursuit      i dont think so these people think the moors are haunted theyllwait for morning im certain if i was them i wouldnt go out on themoors at night      why do you want me to keep a slow pace theres a full moon wecan see the road pretty well      theres a murderer ahead of us lets keep a good distance fromhim i dont say i am also concerned that our little horse could step into arut i dont think he would appreciate my concern for a horse at this time      wells is silent for a moment we should go back to the villagetheyll have the police out there tomorrow theyll want to question us      i sigh wells you have too much book learning to be a goodinvestigator my experience with coppers tells me that if they get ahold ofus we wont be going anywhere for days if were not lynched by thosefarmers back there after they get boozed up the delay would mean idhave to return to new york without answers for me that means thehorseshoe and the kingdoms lost or whatever happened at the battle      for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horsewas lost for want of a horse the rider was lost for want of a rider thebattle was lost for want of a battle the kingdom was lost and all for thewant of a horseshoe nail      that too who uses an ice pick its a rhetorical question not onefor which i expected an answer      an ice pick he repeats      knives guns poison clubs hands and cords for strangling allcommon weapons but an ice pick is a singular weapon      he is silent for a moment and then says the rustlers      come again      a london gang from the whitechapel district they wear americancowboy boots and call themselves rustlers      cowboy boots i repeat      theyre known to kill with ice picks      clean wounds easier to use than a knife placed right in spine heartor brain brings instant results without making noise      but it doesnt make any sense wells shakes his head therewouldnt be a whitechapel thug out here      whitechapel was the violent povertystricken area in london madenotorious for having been the scene for the killings by the fiend known asjack the ripper      its just as likely i tell him to find someone from whitechapel outhere as it would be finding a female newspaper reporter from new york ora teacher from london the person was hired and sent here      why who in gods name would kill that old painter      this time its easy theres only one candidate actually two actingtogether lacroix and radic they are the ones who have a motive to keepisaac silent and im at fault too      what thats nonsense why would you say such a thing      ive left an open trail for a horde to follow the interest i showed inthe bog painting must have been conveyed to radic by lady callistachilcott      and you believe they acted that quickly what took a train tolondon and picked up a rustler off the street in whitechapel    no there must have been a prior connection when i was in drradics office he had a thug there i meet wellss eye he was wearingcowboy boots                                      41we arrive back at the stable after midnight—avoiding being murdered by awhitechapel cowboy or ripped to pieces by a moors beast but we have asleepy angry stableman to deal with meeting his demand to be paid doublesoothes his ruffled feathers but it doesnt get us a ride into the heart of townwhere we can find lodging     taxis stopped hours ago and dont come down here unless they havea fare anyway     we need lodging     he points to the faded word guests on a shingle hanging from thegatepost to his house next door me wife takes in a traveler now andagain     how many rooms do you have i ask     just the one he eyes us youre married arent ya     of course wells says     i give the stableman an extra shilling for a good meal of fruit andyour best grain for our tireless pony     the pony accepts my big hug im going to miss you i whisper inhis ear he nods his head i like to think its his way of telling me hell missme too     the wife greets us at the door sleepyeyed wrapped in a robe with herhair up in curlers fortunately she is less evil tempered about our latearrival than her husband but no less mercenary     the rooms a quid     wells starts to object and i interject well take it     a quid is five dollars16 which is several times more than what imsure her going rate is but i pay it i am too tired to haggle or pack my sorebody and valise to go to another inn     beggars cant be choosers i whisper to wells as we follow thewoman up a dark and narrow stairway the bedroom is tiny with a frumpybrassrailed bed topped with a heavy quilt a small dresser with a washbasinand mirror above it on the wall and a single stuffed chair      the water closet is down the hall      the landlady pauses at the door and turns and smiles at us as we standtogether worn and ready to drop      its so nice to have a good christian couple as our guests      the moment the door closes i fall backward onto the bed oh god iam so sore and tired i could sleep a week      wells collapses in the stuffed chair i confess that had we not gottenthis room i would have laid down on the ground and slept til the sun cameup      i close my eyes and the grim image of isaac weekess eyes poppingblood dribbling from his mouth came to me so does another horriblethought—i am sure i caused him to be targeted for death      dont think about it nellie      what      i could tell from the expression on your face youre agonizing overweekes unfortunately for him weekes signed his own death warrant whenhe did the painting for lacroix if it wasnt you seeking him out it wouldhave been an investigator for lord winsworth the police or anotherreporter and the result would have been the same its a little too much toimagine that we were being followed so quickly that an assassin got tolinleigh before we even decided to go there      thank you i close my eyes again too worn out to get up and takeoff my shoes and freshen up in the washroom down the hall      i am dozing when i hear wells say im sorry      slowly pulling myself into a sitting position i ask what are yousorry about      he is slumped in the chair with his eyes closed his lids open and oureyes meet      for not being the man i would like to be      i see … and what is the reason for this profound observation of yourpresumed failings      you have been paying our way because i dont have money you hadthe courage and determination to stand up to that mob in the village while istood by shocked and speechless i was frightened to set out in the nightthrough the moors because i felt that if we were attacked by the murderer iwould not be strong enough to protect you      men and their egos even wells who insists he wants women to bestrong and equal is slighted if im too assertive      and who made you master of the world mr wells youre notresponsible for me as for what happened in the pub—      he throws up his hands youre going to tell me that you reactedbecause you had experience dealing with a mob before and i poor devilthat i am have only read about mobs      as a matter of fact i was going to say exactly that and while yourecastigating yourself let me tell you something its a rare man of courageand determination indeed who would have left town with a potential possechasing us and a killer on the road i dont know what would have happenedhad we ran into the murderer but i do know that the man i was with hadguts to face the dark night and im confident he would have fought valiantlyfor me had it come to a fight      he stares at me for a long moment      do you really believe that      have you heard me ever say anything i didnt believe      nellie … you do lie a bit      white lies … they dont count      i bend down and kiss him on the forehead thanks for taking care ofme tonight      he pulls my head down and my lips meet his warm and soft andsmooth i can feel the kiss down to my toes i pull back and he stands upand pulls me to him we kiss again      let me make love to you he says      i shove him back into the stuffed chair make yourself comfortableyou can use the floor if the chair doesnt work out i bend down and givehim a peck on the forehead its a true knight in shining armor who lets awoman have the only bed in the place                                     42bright and early the next morning wells and i go to the train stationtogether and obviously buy two tickets to london letting the ticket sellerknow that i am an american and that wells and i are traveling together     short of waving an american flag or mentioning to the ticket sellerthat the police might be inquiring about us i cant think of anything tomake the two of us more conspicuous     when wells slips over to tell a baggage handler that we will besending over several pieces of luggage for our london trip i spot afamiliarlooking black coach waiting on the street as with the carriage ofthe woman in black in bath it is an expensive town coach and has much thesame lines only this time the coat of arms on the door is visible though icant read it from the distance i dont see a passenger as the carriage pullsaway     i just saw a black coach like the one i saw in bath i tell wells whenhe comes back from seeing the baggage man     really…     we next go to the telegraph office where i send a cable to mrcockerill my editor in new york advising him that i am catching the eightoclock train from exeter to london     the message should puzzle my eversuffering editor who constantlycomplains that i never keep him advised of anything in this case since hehas no idea that i am in exeter or probably not even where exeter islocated he will be more surprised than pleased that i advised him i picturehim rubbing his bald head as he tries to figure out what the heck im up to     while at the telegraph office i send a messenger lad to the train stationto purchase a ticket for me south to plymouth our destination is actuallybuckfastleigh a town about halfway to plymouth but since everything i amdoing is to confuse and throw off a pursuit i have only one ticket purchasedin advance and for a destination twice as far as we will be going     wells and i will be going to the station to catch the plymouth train butseparately arriving from two different directions staying strictly awayfrom me he will purchase his ticket just before boarding the train      assuming that someone set out from linleighonthemoor at dawnsearly light to notify the police in exeter of the artists death wells assuresme that a smalltown policeman would not immediately launch a search forus things move very slowly outside of london and liverpool and alsobecause were both a small country and an island it isnt as easy forcriminals to hide were safe for a while      youre sure      yes besides im sure the exeter police will want to investigate thematter first before making arrests based upon what a farmer or shopkeeperfrom linleigh says based on that i calculate that at the very minimum itllbe midday before the police get up to steam and wonder what has happenedto us and if im completely wrong well have a great deal of explaining todo wells gives me a sheepish grin      in other words based upon his lack of practical experience with policeand murder he has absolutely no idea of how and when the police willreact      wonderful i tell him i just hope your calculations are correct      i remind him that while we have a backup plan to tell the police in casewe are apprehended and questioned we need to do it in a manner in whichwe wont find ourselves unable to continue the pursuit      oh what tangled webs we weave when we plan to deceive wellswearily smiles      im sure shakespeare would approve of our continuing the pursuit atall costs      sir walter scott wrote the phrase      whatever they are both dead anyway      i just hope wells says as he opens a café door for me that we havea very imaginative police officer to listen to our story if we have to explainwhy we salted our train ride out of town with false information for thepolice to follow      i dont point out to him that police consider flight in the face of acrime to be an admission of guilt      well i personally am quite pleased at our cleverness i smile atwells after we order breakfast before going to the station     me too do you know that this is the first time ive been wanted bythe police how about you nellie     uh basically… i mumble with burnt toast stuck to the top of mymouth hoping it muffles my response i wonder what he would think of mebeing arrested by the paris police and having to go into hiding for daysfrom them not to mention i started my new york reporting career bygetting arrested as a madwoman and committed to an asylum                                      walking by myself to the train station as we planned my thoughts go tolast night—we both slept deeply from physical and nervous exhaustion buti could have used more rest and im sure wells could have too he wasunable to find a comfortable position to relax on the stuffed chair and endedup curled like a cat on the floor wrapped in a blanket      while i had slept hard i had a difficult time initially getting to sleephaving a man i am attractive to romantically sleeping a few feet from menot only got my thoughts gurgling but those urges women keep a firm reinon were heavy on my mind as i wondered what it would be like to makelove to him      i find myself drawn to him perhaps more than any young man i haveever met i tend to be attracted to older men rather than young men likewells my mother claims its because i was so close emotionally to myfather who was over sixtyyearsold when i was born and lost to our familywhen i was six      wells i believe is about my own age and in truth as he implieshimself he is not the average womans idea of a heartthrob hes neithertall athletically built nor particularly handsome though there is bothpersonal warmth and intellectual intensity about him that i find attractive      i sense a deep current of sensual sexuality within him more passionthan any other man in a casual relationship with me has conveyed i feel hehas caresses ready to be shared passions on the verge of exploding      even though i was shocked at him saying that he believes a man and awoman have a right to sexually explore others outside the relationship evenif they are married what he calls free love its not my cup of tea but irespect his openness and honesty about his own feelings—its refreshingmost men lie or skirt around it      i also am attracted to his analytical approach to so many thingsespecially how he thinks of women—as equals a rare thought in oursociety i know i poke fun about his book smarts but i realize long term ithas greater use and meaning than what my editor has described as mystreet smarts      inviting him into my bed crossed my mind not once but quite a fewtimes but im not prepared for the risk as a modern young woman i amaware of the facts of life and that includes the various methods ofcontraception besides the surest method of all—abstinence      being a woman an unwanted pregnancy is the most dominant thoughtwhen it comes to sex i am certain that wells ranks the satisfaction of hispassions as of primary importance rather than a womans pregnancy since itis almost impossible to prove who the father of a child is      there is a rather awkward but reasonably safe method of contraception—mr goodyears rubbers these are tubes made of rubber that a man canbuy and are usually only purchased by married men kept in a small boxthe rubbers are washed after use coated with a petroleum jelly and thenstored away for the next time coitus is had from what ive overheard fromthe boys in the newsroom one of these vulcanized rubber objects can last anumber of years      suffrage leaders have spoken out against the use of rubbers and havelobbied lawmakers to make their purchase difficult because they believe theuse of the contraceptive gives married men free rein to cheat on their wiveswithout fear of consequences      single men rarely use them except a smart few to avoid syphilis whenhaving sex with a prostitute      the other methods available—withdrawal by the male calculatingones fertile period to avoid it douching and vaginal sponges soaked invinegar are all risky with most of their success based upon wishfulthinking by women ive also been told by some women that theyvesuccessfully used womb veils—a penny inserted inside a womans privatepart      while doing a story on prostitution i was told by a prostitute that sheclamps the mans penis between her thighs leaving him with the impressionthat he is having vaginal intercourse she claimed that men she had sex withrarely realized they were not actually entering her      however you cut it the techniques are highly risky and most of themwould take the pleasure out of lovemaking      with the train station in sight and the possibility of policemen waitingfor us i put away my girlish thoughts about sex and worry about beingarrested for murder  part iiidartmoortheres the scarlet thread of murder running through the colorless skein of life and ourduty is to unravel it and isolate it and expose every inch of it                                 —sir arthur conan doyle a study in scarlet                                    43                        buckfastleigh devonshireconan doyle mulled over the telegram he received from oscar wilde anamerican reporter famous for her stunt reporting including a race aroundthe world to beat a record that existed only on paper and a young scienceteacher were on their way to consult him      the scottish author was a medical doctor but from the context of thetelegram he already knew the visit was not to be about their health but amystery that featured black beasts and the death of the womans friend      rereading the telegram he chuckled over oscars description of thesituation in which oscar described the purpose of the visit as work on anovel clever of him to make it a work of fiction conan doyle thoughtsince telegrams pass through a number of hands as they make their wayfrom sender to receiver      oscar had an amazing mind a clever wit and a tongue that could laybare the worst hypocrisies the thing he lacked most besides respectabilitywas modesty an incredible persona that could leave people awed he oftenspoke in hyperboles understatements were not his strong point that wasfor sure nor was keeping a low profile a fact which made him a target forgossip and personality assassination      doyle hoped that the two visitors had simply come for informationabout the legend of the black beast the great hound that is said to be theevil reincarnation of an evil man who lost his soul to the devil      the other possibility was that they had come seeking help solving amystery that was a problem he faced since his fictional detective caughtthe interest of a reading audience      when he is asked to step into the shoes of his fictional detective andsuch requests have ranged from a police inspector investigating a crime to abusinessman plagued by theft he explains that while sherlock holmes maysound like he is unraveling a complex problem holmes in fact knows allthe facts and the solution from the very beginning because i dontscribble out the story until i have all the puzzling facts and clever answersalready jotted down he tells them deflating the notion that he could standin the shoes of his detective and solve a mystery      people were generally disappointed doyle thought when they foundout that he was himself neither a master detective nor was his protagonist asspontaneous as they imagined some people even believed that there was anactual detective that he based the stories upon and he had in fact borrowedthe traits of a living person when he constructed his fictional detective      dissatisfied with his medical practice which proved a constantstruggle to make a living at and which over a few short years moved himfrom one city to another in a quest to build a profitable practice he finallyset out to write      storytelling was in his blood his father had been a great teller of talesto him as a child and doyle had gone from listening to tales to becoming avoracious reader of them reading tales of honor and adventure had filledthe gaps in his own life permitting him to experience at least vicariouslywhat few men had experienced in real life      finding his historical writing attracted neither publishers nor readershe had turned to writing a mystery novel featuring a detective storiesfeaturing a detective had been done before and he particularly admired onecreated by edgar allan poe in what was considered the first story featuringa private detective or as doyle preferred to think of him a consultingdetective      poes tale the murders in the rue morgue featured c auguste dupinas a detective smarter than the police in solving a crime that seemedcompletely impossible to have been committed but solve it dupin dideven though the solution was rather bizarre because as conan doyle hashis own detective observe once you eliminate the impossible whateverremains no matter how improbable must be the truth      conan doyle also admired the thought processes of a french policeofficer monsieur lecoq created by author émile gaboriau and the waylecoq didnt just collect information about a crime but used reasoning andwhat little forensic science was available to solve offenses      he paid homage to the american and french writers who he drewupon to create his own detective by having sherlock holmes claim he was abetter detective than either of them     after several not very successful ventures in storytelling he knew thatto succeed to catch the eye of a publisher and the loyalty of readers he hadto come up with something different as a person trained in the art ofmedical science he knew that doctors approached diagnosing an illness notunlike an investigators approach to solving a crime his professor at theuniversity joseph bell had drilled into his students that a successfuldiagnosis was the recognition in the symptoms of the minor differences—those differences leading the doctor to eliminate causes in order to arrive atthe one that most fits the symptoms     it occurred to doyle that that was exactly how a detective shouldanalyze a crime—looking for the minor perhaps almost imperceptibledifferences in the evidence that lead from one suspect to another until theactual cause and perpetrator is found through a series of deductionsobservations and arriving at conclusions     viewing crime solving as a science not just an art was to be theformula he would use to create his detective     he created a character named sherrinford holmes then simplified thename to sherlock and gave him a sidekick dr watson to act as both a foiland a sparring partner for holmes     his first sherlock holmes book a study in scarlet was to be a majordisappointment to him in many ways first presenting a manuscript to apublisher is a trying task for any writer manuscripts are handwritten canrun into hundreds of pages and he had to laboriously copy by hand theentire manuscript for each publisher to which he submitted     the reaction from publishers was also not elating to find publishersrejecting his story after all the work and enthusiasm he put into writing itand the grim task of hand copying was deflating to his ego and hisaspirations     though he had been insulted by an offer of twentyfive pounds17 froma publisher to purchase all rights to the story with no further payment ofroyalties he accepted the offer     publication was followed by such a lukewarm reception from readersthat he cast aside the sherlock holmes character intending never to writeanother book about the detective who solved cases with scientific deductivereasoning      for four years he floundered trying to get his medical practice in goodorder while he wrote other stories that publishers and readers found evenless gripping than the holmes book      his writing career had undergone a dramatic change the previous yearduring a dinner at londons langham hotel that night he and oscarwilde a poet and social wit who doyle had never met before and whohimself had never had a novel previously published were both offeredsurprisingly respectable publishing arrangements by an american publisherof magazines who desired to publish the novels in weekly installments      the reason he received an offer from an american publisher was thathis holmes novel had proved more popular in the united states than inbritain and the offer while modest for the amount of work it would take tocreate the story was much fairer than the previous one18      even better the short novel he produced the sign of the four was asignificant hit in both europe and america leading to publishingagreements for more sherlock holmes stories                                conan doyle      at thirtyone years and just beginning to have the success for which hehad strived for years he felt old and still dissatisfied with his medicalpractice      it was probably the slow passive nature of his familyoriented practicethat kept him from fully loving the profession he had studied so hard toobtain      thinking about the cryptic message he had received he decided thevisitors would provide an intriguing interlude for what had been a ratherdull afternoon while he was on holiday from his medical practice he didhave an occasional request for his medical services in buckfastleigh fromacquaintances      death and the black beast had to enliven a day in which the mostexciting moment had been an elderly patient telling him that he had finallyunplugged this morning after eating a large number of prunes                                      44no police are waiting for us at buckfastleigh neither is a taxi     we are told a taxi only comes to the station when it has been requestedin advance buckfastleigh is a small town a market town larger thanlinleighonthemoors but still too small to host many city amenities     we get instructions for old bridge house where conan doyle isstaying since it is only a half mile walk not terribly far since neither of ushas a large piece of luggage though wellss is more than twice the size ofmy valise we set out on foot instead of by taxi     wells i hate to admit it but my limited knowledge about conandoyle is from what oscar told me—that his first name is arthur but heprefers to be called conan and i have a confession to make     really … this should be interesting     i havent read any of mr doyles books     but you said—     a little white lie i uh glanced at it in a bookstore i meant to read itsomeday     what is the purpose of this confession     i was just thinking that since youve read his detective stories youdbe so kind as to tell me the plots so i could be courteous and pretend i hadread them     to my surprise he refuses thats not polite its a fraud besides itsvery easy to get tripped up     ive done it many times and never had a problem     why dont you just read the books     because mr wells i say tartly i am quite too busy climbingmountains crossing rivers and storming castles to have my head constantlystuck in a book as i have pointed out to help you improve youropportunities in life you spend too much time reading instead of doing     you are absolutely right miss bly in fact i have been counting myblessings since you brought action rather than just words into my life todate i am wanted by the police stalked by a killer and in the hands of awoman who was committed to a madhouse after being examined by threepsychiatrists one has to wonder how you managed to pull off beinghopelessly insane so well im sure youve heard that expression—wheretheres smoke theres fire19     so he knows about my insanity caper i shut my mouth and grit myteeth sometimes the man is insufferable     on occasion i have also found wells mulish with his attitudes and idrop the subject knowing we will just end up in petty squabbling while iadmire his fine mind cold logic and reason can be the enemy of invention                                     old bridge house sits next to a narrow stone bridge that looks ancientenough to have been used by celtic farmers to herd sheep across and thenby roman legions marching to conquest in the distance upriver there is amodern railroad span of steel girders that time and man will turn into a pileof rusty dust while the stone edifice built by hand will still be feeling thefoot and wheels of mankind     i would feel quite at home in the house next to the bridge if houseshave a spirit i would say this one was a tranquil old soul     what a charming house i tell wells its another moorstone granitebut larger than any we saw in linleighonthemoors with four chimneysand a large stone archway over the entrance to the property big enough for acarriage to pass through thatch moss and clinging vines cover the roofand top of the arch     the bell at the front door reminds me of the one we had at the housemy dad built for my mother—smooth gray metal that appears almost liquidand a little handle that looks like a fish tail to ring the bell with     miss bly and mr wells … welcome conan doyle greets us after iclang the bell please come in     my instant impression of the author is that he appears to be in themedical professional he is—or even a counterjumper i think because drdoyle looks a bit like h g wells with a similar thick dark mustachethough he is a larger man     the house and its furnishings are old and venerable as seems conandoyle though wells told me earlier that the man is only in his early thirtiesand while his features are that of a young man he impresses me as an oldsoul as he observes me with a grave expression and large gray eyes thatradiate intelligent curiosity      i read about your exploits when you passed through london on yourrace dr doyle says to me i was less amazed at your accomplishment intiming transportation than the raw courage it took to travel around the worldwhen there is danger everywhere oscar told me that you even refused tocarry the pistol that a friend offered      the problem with relying upon guns is that it encourages others to getbigger ones or more of them to fight you with thank you for thecompliment but i must say the honor of our meeting is all mine dr doylei so love your sherlock holmes stories      thank you which one did you find most entertaining      oh… i chirp and gesture to wells as i am sinking beyond despairwhy didnt i read the books all of them      she enjoyed both a study in scarlet and the sign of the four wellssays as did i ive written a few modest scientific articles but hopesomeday to break into writing fiction      a word of advice write because you desire to not for the money orfame—that may take longer than you think or never come now shall we gointo the parlor      wells gives me an i told you so glare as dr doyle leads us to theparlor      we settle into some charming overstuffed chairs and partake of tea andcake while we chat      i dont want to discourage you from writing fiction dr doyle tellswells that isnt my intent but it can be as it was for me a bumpydepressing road before even modest success taking up the pen can be liketaking a wolf by the ear      miss bly… mr doyle looks me      yes i silently cross my fingers hoping he wont ask me somethingspecific about his books      please tell me what pitfalls you must encounter reporting crimestories especially being a woman which im very impressed by oscar isright when he said you are one of a kind      thank you for a moment i look down at my napkin im really notused to compliments especially from men the biggest difficulty is gettingthe newspaper to believe a woman is capable of such a task they believe awomans place is in the home i give him a brief rundown of wrongs ihave exposed from the miserable conditions at a madhouse to the treatmentof domestics and the terrible life prostitutes endure      i get chuckles when i share with them jules vernes agitation over therefusal of the french academy to make him a member because they preferwhat he calls comedies of manners over his bestselling adventure stories      very quickly the small talk and war stories are over and we face thetask of explaining why i have journeyed several thousand miles and teamedup with wells im not sure how wells feels about me giving the writer arather whitewashed version of events but from the way he is looking downat the floor a jury would easily peg him as guilt stricken      the most significant details i omitted are the interest that new yorkpolice have in haileys handling of the new york murder case because ididnt want to take away any sympathy dr doyle would have for her andthat wells and i are presently sought for questioning by the british police      the fact we are probably on a wanted list would most likely get usescorted to the nearest constable by the respectable doctorwriter      dr doyle shows keen interest in the conversation i overheardregarding the child emma at the spa he stops me from going further withmy tale and asks me to repeat everything i know about emma and herprostitute mother scoffing when i say the child died suddenly of brainfever      the deuce you say dr doyle rubs his jaw brain fever whatbunk the use of a child at the spa for any purpose is completelyoutrageous the authorities in bath are obviously overlooking the situationbecause the spa attracts a wealthy and influential clientele and you h gin dealing with dr lacroix youve never heard of children being used in hisexperiments      no children were not experimented upon as far as i know nor did ihear anything about children in regard to his university difficulties but ionly did research for him for a short time so he may have had childreninvolved at some point and i just wasnt privy to the experiments      im not familiar with dr lacroix dr doyle says though iveheard of the spa does he strike you as even capable of doing experimentsthat could harm a child his question is directed to wells      wells chews on it for a moment i dont find lacroix to be an evilperson in the sense that anyone would look upon him as capable of doingdeliberate harm or acts of a criminal nature i find it difficult to believe thathe would intentionally harm a child however there is no question hebecomes quite fanatical in terms of his medical research i have no directevidence to support this just my impression from observing him but istrongly suspect that he could consider experiments on a child that hebelieves are being done for the greater good of mankind no different thanexperimenting on an adult or even an animal      ah yes like jenner and the smallpox researchers dr doyle tapstobacco down in his pipe and lights it before he continues as you bothmay recall during the closing years of the past century jenner was a smalltown doctor in gloucestershire he was an inquisitive sort enjoyedexperimenting with medical remedies smallpox epidemics were frequent inthose days killing tens of millions around the world and leaving many moremillions scarred and blind but he had observed that one group of workersnever seemed to come down with the disease—milkmaids who had gottencowpox a disease similar to but much less lethal and damaging thansmallpox      jenner ultimately came up with a procedure that he calledvaccination from the latin word for cow vacca where he injects peoplewith a small amount of cowpox as you know it does protect most peoplefrom coming down with smallpox so the benefit to mankind is enormous      however during that era when jenner and other physicians weretrying to discover the cure it was not an uncommon practice to conductdangerous experiments on people especially prisoners and small childrensome of those experimented upon naturally died or otherwise suffered thehorrible consequences of smallpox or other foul diseases before the ultimatecure was reached medical science was crude cruel and ignorant at thetime and some of these ghastly experiments really fell more under theauspices of alchemy than true scientific research      i can see why they would use prisoners i interject prisoners haveless to lose and can be rewarded with money and their freedom but whatwas the attraction of the experimenters to use children      availability and lack of resistance to whatever is done to them ishould have qualified that statement to say poor children the children wereobtainable for a price as was the prostitutes daughter      if you dug up the researchers from their graves wells says and askthem if buying poor children for their experiments was cruel no doubt theywould point out that most of the children would never have lived to reachadulthood anyway      regretfully that was true then and still is i point out      doyle leans back with his pipe blowing smoke up as i was sayingthere were experiments conducted with children and that included infectingthem with pus from smallpox sores the end result of this eras experimentswas a vaccine for smallpox and a great benefit for mankind but thatprovided small comfort for the many children who suffered horrible deathsto pave the way and from what you have told me about dr lacroix hisexperiments are for the benefit of mankind at any cost and it seems he alsohas a bit of the alchemist in him no doubt his aims are for the better goodof all but his vision is twisted i shall write a letter to the royal coroner inbath pointing out that a review should be made of the childs death      another puff of smoke and dr doyle invites me to continue my tale      i stall with a sip of tea to get my thoughts in order we are now ondangerous ground and i need to use various shades of white lies to avoidtelling doyle about the murder of the artist wells and i had argued over thispoint on the walk from the train station because he wants to relate the entirematter to dr doyle insisting that the man would hold us in utter contemptlater when the inevitable happens and he discovers we lied to him while iwould enjoy the respect of dr doyle if lying is the best way to handle thesituation then i shall not falter in doing so      we witnessed a murder yesterday      that came from wells      so much for being clever      the startled expression on arthur conan doyles features makes mewonder if we are about to wear out our welcome at old bridge house      i give a little sigh set down my teacup fold my hands in my lap andgive wells a small gentle smile despite my inclination to poke out one ofhis eyes for having uttered the naked truth                                     45i take center stage from wells in the hope of salvaging some of thecooperation i was anticipating the writerdoctor would give us      we were innocent bystanders of course i offer dr doyle      that goes without saying but he smiles after meeting the two ofyou i have to wonder which of the two of you or the three of us for thatmatter is the most innocent in the ways of the world      wells and doyle enjoy a male chuckle at my expense and wells raiseshis hand as if he had been asked a question in school      i confess dr doyle our world traveler is much more versed on theworld than i who has stayed warm before the hearth with my feet inslippers and my head in a book      if you gentlemen are finished poking fun at me i shall go on      please do dr doyle says and dont take our little slings andarrows too seriously i am certain that wells and i have the same opinion ofyou as has much of the world—you are a woman of great determination andtalent      thank you glowing i go on we need to start a bit before theevents of last night what drew us to dartmoor was a painting i saw when ivisited lady chilcott a wealthy middleaged matron in bath who takes thecure at the spa and who is a supporter and admirer of dr lacroix myimpression is that her admiration may also be of a romantic nature      not a surprising reaction dr doyle says to a doctor you describeas both attractive to women and who offers them eternal youth and beauty      i relate how i saw the painting of the bog that is the source of the peatmoss used at the spa and how i was told by lady chilcott that the paintinghad been commissioned by dr lacroix and presented to her as a gift forassisting in financing his research      research into what you call magic mud dr doyle says      i shrug and shake my head i know peat moss preserves bodies but sodoes ice and formaldehyde perhaps they should have people at the spa alsobathe in chilled embalming fluid     but you see nellie to lacroix a tiny glimmer of hope that asubstance in peat moss can be isolated to rejuvenate skin bursts like anexploding star in his head he sees a benefit to mankind and scientificimmortality for himself as its discoverer     i explain how we tracked the artist to linleighonthemoors a villagedoyle says hed seen on maps but had not traveled to after i told himabout the ice pick and the cowboy boots on the bath spa thug dr doylealso immediately made a connection with the whitechapel gang in londonafter i tell him about the death of weekes and the avoidance of the policeby wells and myself in exeter he is red faced and i know we are in trouble     you must go to the police immediately this spa and its villains mustbe put behind bars before they hurt others     even wells realizes it is time to backpedal or we will shortly be in thehands of the police—literally he resorts to the truth again telling dr doylethat going to the police would mean an abrupt stop in our investigation anda return to new york for me without finding out what had happened tohailey     were not withholding any evidence vital to a police pursuit of thelinleigh murderer he tells doyle we saw nothing of the killer whileothers at the pub did including the barmaid who served him as for theconnection between the spa in bath and the killing in the village its a realreach to connect a man with cowboy boots at the spa with an ice pick killerin linleigh via a notorious gang in london—     youre right dr doyle cuts in the connection is obvious to usbecause you have experienced the incidents firsthand and three of us arepeople of imagination but there isnt a policeman in dartmoor or probablylondon for that matter who wouldnt find the connection farfetched thatdoesnt excuse you from evading the police but he rubs his jaw if youcant identify the killer theres no harm done is there you can justproclaim your ignorance of police matters     we could if wells doesnt get an irresistible impulse to confess ourcharade at the exeter train station but i am much relieved by the doctorsanalysis and the fact he doesnt appear ready to turn us over to the nearestconstable     another problem i add of convincing the police of the connectionbetween the crimes is that cowboy boots are not just worn by thewhitechapel gang oscar says they are a fashion item in london     now that you mention it wells says i recall reading in the papersthat oscar and the crowd he hangs out with have taken to wearing themwith evening wear seems oscar still has a pair from the tour he made ofthe american west     doyle relights his pipe and blows out smoke going a step further ifthe chief inspector in bath says that the prostitutes death was a suicide thatwill be the finding of the coroner and that matter will close tight trying toconnect the death of the unfortunate artist in the moors because he had oncepainted a landscape for the doctor a pair of cowboy boots on a spaemployee and a gang in london … as you say quite a reach in imaginationfor a police officer whose duty is to view the evidence objectively and notmake imaginative connections     with due respect to you nellie and the battles in life you have foughtand won the average police officer hearing the tale youve told me wouldassume that your suspicions are a result of female hysterics     it wouldnt be the first time that conclusion was drawn     oscars telegram also said you wanted to speak to me about the blackhoundlike beast that is sometimes claimed to have been spotted in themoors the story and claims of seeing the beast and victims of the creaturego back centuries it piqued my interest because that type of creature hasbeen spotted in other parts of england and i am in fact researching thelegend for possible use in a future book20 how does the story fit into thismatter     were not certain that it does wells says however its an issue wefeel necessary to pursue because dr lacroix had an interest in the blackbeast at a pub over some pints he confided in me that he would somedayscientifically investigate the black beast legend his theory is that the beastwas a primordial animal perhaps a creature left over from the age ofdinosaurs—     and that creature was preserved over the ages in a peat moss bogdr doyle says and miraculously came alive one day he is also a man ofimagination     what we would like to know is whether there is a particular bog onthe moors that the story of the beast has been identified with i ask     no there isnt and i owe you an apology for rudely usurping the restof the tale but by now i have a little insight into what i perceive aslacroixs thought processes and saw the conclusion it smacks of greatlogic and scientific nonsense but more particularly as to your questionabout the beast there are two stories about the hound that lacroix couldhave been referring to     one arises from a squire about three hundred years ago here inbuckfastleigh one richard cabell he was the most important landownerin the area and not one who found favor in the eyes of those who workedfor him or had to deal with him its claimed he sold his soul to the devil foreternal life but the devil tricked him making him a houndlike creature afterhe died he has been sighted many times in the area and there have beenmany claims of deaths or near misses     the second tale of beastly hounds is that of the yeth hound a giantcoal black beast with flaming eyes that terrorizes people at night in amanner similar to the buckfastleigh animal however other than the factthat both creatures appear in tales of the moors and there are bogs in themoors i know of no connection between the stories and any particularbog     my disappointment shows on my face and i give dr doyle a smile inreturn for his raised eyebrows yes im disappointed i really hoped thatlacroixs comment about the black beast is a clue to locating his bog ofmagic mud i am convinced that if we find the bog we will find himsomewhere in the area     and what do you plan to do if you find him ask him as a gentlemanand medical professional to kindly accompany you to the nearest policemanand turn himself in after he confesses of course he winces i dontmean to be facetious my dear i just dont want the two of you going intoharms way against a man you believe has commissioned murder without aclear plan for your safety     wells chuckles let me assure you im neither as brave nor daring asnellie when i am certain that i know lacroixs whereabouts the mattershall be handed over to the nearest police officer     i let out a sigh and apologize to the gentlemen sorry now that wehave hit a dead end i feel deflated      dont be my dear you are simply tired from all the hurdles you twohave been vaulting i suggest you take a day or two of rest before youbounce off in whatever direction your bloodhound instincts take you      he gets up and we start walking toward the front door      we beg your forgiveness for having intruded upon you wells saysbut we hoped the black hound tale would point us in the right direction      no bother at all in fact a welcome break from the hard task ofwriting feel free to wire me if you have any more questions and let meknow if you come up with more tales of moor hounds as ive said i mayuse one in a book someday      there is the other hound the lady howard one that weekes theartist claims he saw when he was painting the bog picture      lady howards coach dog doyle isnt asking but stating he stopsand unconsciously taps his pipe in his hand are you saying that the artistclaims to have seen lady howard when he was painting the bog portrait      yes      well he smiles as if he found something hed been missing ifthats the case isaac weekes shot an arrow in that conversation that pointedtoward your magic mud you had better sit down      we hurry back into the parlor my heart in my throat because conandoyle is not a man to exaggerate      the lady howard legend is about a death coach like thebuckfastleigh hound its based upon a real person that lived severalhundred years ago and has grown with its telling its also somewhatreminiscent of the goddess of death who travels through the nightcollecting human souls as with the local squire here lady howard was anunpleasant woman quite as mean and miserly as one can accomplish whilebeing very wealthy      as he talks he picks up a folder and begins to leaf through what iassume are research notes      its been said that she beat her children regularly without cause andeven disinherited them a not very kind gesture toward those who looked toher for guidance and support the sightings of her are between the clockstriking midnight and the cocks crow her ghoulish coach has beendescribed as made from the blackened bones of the many husbands shemurdered its pulled by a great beast of a hound a black dog with sharpfangs and fire in its eyes i confess that my favorite version of the taleclaims that lady howard like our curmudgeon squire runs through thenight herself in the form of a hell hound ah here it is lady howardsdevon ballad passed down over the centuries     he reads from the notebook    my ladye hath a sable coach    and horses two and four    my ladye hath a black bloodhound    that runneth on before    my ladyes coach hath nodding plumes    the driver hath no head    my ladye is an ashen white    as one that long is dead21     this is all very interesting but i am still on the edge of my chairwaiting to hear why lady howard was an arrow shot by the artist     do you see how simple it should be for the two of you to find thebog     no wells and i echo     doyle grins at us why its elementary my dear watsons ladyhowards ghost haunts the castle ruins of okehampton if the painter sawher ghost he was most assuredly near the castle                                    46i have visited okehampton castle dr doyle tells us some years ago iwasnt researching beasts of the moors stories at that time and now regretmy stopover wasnt between midnight and the cocks crow it would havegotten my creative juices flowing not to mention my adrenaline had ispotted the wicked old woman hopefully my blood would not haveflowed too he asks wells youre not familiar with okehampton      not at all im afraid      its a days journey perhaps two depending on how you intend to getthere okehampton is almost due north of buckfastleigh thirty miles or soas the crow flies but that direct route from here to okehampton is straightthrough part of the wildest and most sparsely populated part of the moorsthe path has few villages and even less civilized accommodationshowever if you took the train back to exeter or to plymouth to make aconnection to okehampton you would travel much farther but also quickerand in infinitely greater comfort      wells and i exchange glances and i can see that for once we are inagreement neither of us wish to risk getting back on the train until we havesomething positive to report to the police to explain our strange behavior      i see doyle says trains are out unfortunately      he shows us a map of the region no question okehampton is astraight shot almost across the very center of dartmoor doyle says the fewmarkings of any sort between buckfastleigh and okehampton are mostlysmall villages some of which are no more than a few houses clustered nearcrossroads      i dearly hope you understand the task you are undertaking if youattempt to cross the moors      ive traveled in the wild west and mexico i proudly state      yes nellie and im sure rattlesnakes and bandits are bad hombresbut crossing the moors is probably more like trekking the badlands of marsif you will forgive the otherworldly analogy      how so      there is a reason the moors generate so many tales of the haunted andthe horrid—it is a strange place strange as in eerie—as in haunted even inbroad daylight the land is unusual its vestiges twisted and grotesque thereare constant tales of ghosts heres one related to me by another doctor apatient brought his wife in because she was in horrible fright it seems shewouldnt believe the servants when they told her they wouldnt go for milkin the late afternoon because a woman in a gray cloak walked on the road atdusk fed up she decided to investigate the matter herself      one evening she went out to milk the cows and there on the road wasa woman in a gray cloak she followed her and the woman disappearedover an impossibly steep place the woman went for help but no body wasfound by the rescuers the next night she went out again and once againthere was the woman in a gray clock walking and again she ended up goingover the steep place      he pauses and raises his eyebrows i know the woman and she is assane as any of us so a word of caution be very careful you never knowwhat you will find out there      what about the bogs i ask are they as dangerous as ive heardtell      you read and hear about the trembling earth dr doyle continueswith his tale of horrors places where you suddenly find yourself walkingon bogs without realizing that the greenery underfoot is not solid groundbut is literally thin ice ready to break with your footfall and send yousinking into a mire that feels as if it has grabbed hold of your feet and ispulling you under he raises his eyebrows if you should fall into a bogbe sure to remember to treat it as you would quicksand—dont strugglebecause its counterproductive fighting the suction will just pull you underfaster i am told that the correct posture is to spread yourself out and try tolie upon it spreading out your weight rather than pushing your feet downinto it      i hope it wont become necessary for us to perform bog survivalwells says but we need to remember the advice      wells gives me a look that raises my dander i know what he isimplying—i will not bother learning the survival technique until i amconfronted with the danger he is right of course but if i tried to learneverything thrown at me in life i would have no room in my head forinvestigating and writing news stories     well have to rent a carriage i say     would be difficult though youll only need a buggy since i assumeyou wont desire to make a round trip i have a pony buggy you can useshall we go out to the stable     we follow doyle as he continues telling us about okehampton     in okehampton you can hire a man at the stable to bring it back tome the long way of course you would have difficulty finding someoneeager to come through the wild area     its a dartmoor pony buggy i ask     yes but i use two ponies to pull my large frame even though theresan inn on your way youll need bedrolls and extra food with poor roadsand uncertain weather you might find darkness falling quickly and be inneed of shelter short of the inn     how long do you think it will take us     the good part of two days if it doesnt rain hard and your buggywheels dont get too bogged down too often in mud youll find by theway that the ruins of okehampton castle are a pretty picture its atop awooded spur above the river okement it was once the largest castle indevonshire before its last owner ran afoul of henry viii and lost his headhis castle slowly dissolved into a ruin haunted by that rather nasty oldwoman i told you about     he helps wells harness the two ponies as i make a list of items toobtain from the general store     when the buggy preparations are done he stands by and we have along moment of quiet i have found dr doyle to be an interesting personwith many facets like wells he is someone whose intellect not onlychallenges me but inspires me to reach deeper into myself when faced witha problem     conan doyle tells us rather sadly you are going on an adventure idlove to come with you but i have my medical practice on my back and asherlock holmes tale in my head     he gives one pony a slap on the rump go now the games afoot                                   47we drive away from the writer of mystery stories in silence both of uswishing he had been able to join us     it is late in the afternoon and we want to get on our way we take theroad to ashburton which dr doyle told us is a small town but will be thelargest community we pass through after we leave the main road and enterthe very heart of dartmoor it will be our last chance to purchase thesupplies we will need     before we left the house dr doyle pulled out a map of dartmoor andwent over it with us     the route will take you through some very small villages withaccommodations and a number of settlements which have a few housesclustered together and others spread out on farmlands and grazing fieldsmost of the settlements have no shops or lodging as you already know theroads will be very narrow depending on how you go some dirt roads willbecome mere paths but you should try to avoid those it will probably rainand that makes the roads even nastier     now from what youve told me you plan to go as much as possiblethe way the crow flies i appreciate your need for expediency but gettingoff of what passes for the beaten path in the wilds of the moors is not agood idea youll need a compass and of course good waterproofs…     so much has happened during the past few days i feel a bit drainedrather than chomping at the bit as i normally would as we set off wellsalso appears to appreciate the solitude     we are closing in on our goal i am certain of that     we are both convinced that we will find lacroix at or nearokehampton castle ive mulled over isaac weekess remark about ladyhoward and im convinced that as a dartmoor local he would know thatlady howard only appears at okehampton castle if she had appearedsomewhere else i think he would have mentioned it     not that a ghost should be expected anywhere and the skeptic in mehas to wonder what he had imbibed that night before he saw the ghost      a decision pressing on both of us is a realistic response to the questiondr doyle asked what is our plan once we locate dr lacroix      i hardly plan to walk up to him with a list of people i believe hesmurdered—or had murdered—and ask him for a confession not to mentionthat he might slice me to ribbons with one of his scalpels if i were so boldor he might have some whitechapel rustlers hanging around pronging thelice on their cowboy boots with their ice picks while they wait for the nextvictim to show up      we said wed go to the police but only when we have solidinformation to hand them we could reveal to the police that lacroix isnton the continent but that has doubtful consequences because hes not awanted criminal even if the bath police have questions for him the factthey are not actively seeking him is a good indication that they have nothingincriminating to firmly link lady winsworths death to the spa and drlacroix doesnt sound like the type who would run off the mouth duringpolice questioning and incriminate himself      thinking can be dangerous when it comes to you wells saysinterrupting my musing      i was thinking about lacroix and lady winsworth the police hadthe spa waters the elixir concoction the peat moss baths all of them testedand found nothing poisonous      correct people take those types of products every day by the manythousands if you count the number of people drinking and bathing in similarwaters all over europe and i imagine america      so the only reason the spa is suspected is because she appears to havebeen in good health      no natural causes like a heart attack or stroke were found and shehad taken nothing out of the ordinary except from the spa      we are moving along at a nice pace and wells barely needs to holdonto the reins the dartmoor ponies seem to know where they are goingand what speed they need wish i could take one back to america with memost children get a dog or cat for their first pet—mine was a pony from mydad because of that horses have always held a soft spot in my heart22when my father died i rode my pony alongside his casket     his voice breaks my thoughts no evidence of a known poison wasfound by the medical examiner either though as dr lacroix or anyhematologist would tell you the scientific analysis of blood for anythingother than recognized diseases and toxins is very inadequate     then it wasnt anything at the spa     what how do you conclude that     being around conan doyle has gotten my detective juices flowingyou told me that sherlock holmes says that if you eliminate the impossiblewhatever remains no matter how improbable must be the truth its notpossible that the spas stinky water and magic mud baths are the causebecause everyone else gets them and hasnt died or gotten sick enough todraw attention what remains is the improbable conclusion that her deathwasnt from something at the spa     all right whats on your list of causes not at the spa     my short list includes a child     wells nods emma the prostitutes daughter but we dont knowwhat her role was there     no thats not exactly true i think that focusing on a connectionbetween emma and the spa misleads us her connection is more to drlacroix     he gives me a sharp look how do you know that youve beenwithholding things from me again     not at all i have simply looked at the evidence     now you are sounding like sherlock holmes i guess that makes mewatson     we both laugh its a nice interlude to our problems     there is no question that the child has a spa connection i tell himbecause she was solicited through the spa but from what i determinedfrom talking to lady chilcott the child was never used as part of the cureroutine at the spa     perhaps not for her but how about others     she socializes with others at the spa and im sure a child being usedin treatment would have been a subject of talk besides shes not just acustomer at the spa like your lady winsworth she was a financialsupporter of lacroix and i suspect both the women were his lovers too      nonsense wells suddenly snapped lady winsworth was neverlacroixs lover she was interested in keeping her beauty thats all      wellss reaction is a strong emotion obviously hes not just protectingthe reputation of a woman who was his friend and benefactor      lets go back to your theory about the child he says flatly      her mother sarah told me that the little girl had been promised anice trip from the spa people      a nice trip thats what she said      those were her words i regret that i didnt think about them at thetime but i didnt know then that i would be taking a trip to find lacroix      you believe well find the child in okehampton      no the childs dead im certain of that      why      because theres no reason for radic to pretend otherwise theprostitute was a serious embarrassment coming to the spa maybe talking topeople she saw coming and going if the child was still alive he would havegotten rid of the annoyance by showing her the child or even taking sarahto her wherever she was bought another child for that matter it seemseasy enough for doctors but that doesnt mean the child died in bath sarahalso complained that there was no grave to visit      so you believe what we find at okehampton will be the concoctionthat killed emma and lady winsworth that means it probably wont be themagic mud at least not in the form used at the spa      exactly how long ago was it that you caught on to the fact lacroixwas setting up a lab in this region      a couple of months      so he could have had plenty of time to set up the lab and concoctwhatever killed lady winsworth and the child youve told me that hes afanatic about his research hell still be there cooking up whatever in histest tubes looking for the secret to unlocking the disease of growing oldand wrinkled      youre right wells sighs lacroix is no longer in control of hisresearch im certain that by now the science has driven him quite madcrazy enough to kill people to accomplish his aims like dr jekyll andvictor frankenstein there comes a point where a researcher becomes soblinded by his ambition to recreate in a test tube what only god has createdthat the science devours the man      wells gives me a long look like the fictional mad scientists lacroixhas left a bloody trail of murder in his wake                                    48we pick up salted beef bread dry cheese that wont spoil in cool air andfruit at a general store also a compass and more rugged waterproofsbecause we could spend hours sitting on a buggy in the rain      once again we sought out an inn away from the center of town thisone on the road that will lead us in the direction of widecombeonthemoors where we expect to find civilized accommodations if we are unableto make it all the way across the moors because foul weather forces us toseek shelter      i suggest we pretend to be married and get one room again wellssays      i give him a stern look and what would be the purpose of that      to keep you from speaking were just another couple amongthousands until you say something and people know you are american      he is right there is also no question in my mind that he is asmotivated by lust as he is to hide my accent      you get the floor again i tell wells      well flip a coin for the bed      not if im paying      you get the bed      i smile and make vague listening responses as wells registers us as mrand mrs prendick at the inns front desk      where did you get the name prendick i ask wells on our way tothe room      it was a friend of my fathers who was lost in a shipwreck      great it doesnt seem propitious to adopt the name of a dead manwhen tomorrow well be back in the haunted moors with bogs that swallowpeople but i keep my peace rather than expose my superstitious nature      dining is a communal affair at the inn with several large tables thataccommodate about ten people each to ensure i wont have to hold aconversation and end up broadcasting that i am an american we avoid thetwo tables that have diners even though theres room for us and find seatsnear the wall at the far end of the room     theyll assume were honeymooners and desire privacy to coo overthe caresses well be sharing tonight wells says     i lean close to him just a kiss away and whisper i hope you have anice pillow to share your love with tonight     food is brought to the table in communal bowls and platters boiledlamb potatoes green beans cabbage and bread     as we eat we have the map of dartmoor between us it lists quite anumber of places but as dr doyle had pointed out most of them are whathe called settlements little more than a small group of houses along theroad in a thinly populated area he told us wed most likely find more sheepand ponies than twolegged creatures once we got past ashburton     i suck in a sharp gasp of air as a man suddenly sits down in the chairnext to wells and smirks smug and arrogant—this is the man who attackedme in london     you know my old boss at the yard always said that lifes a circle andif you stand in one spot long enough the criminal you want to apprehendwill come strolling back to you     thats a surprise i counter not the circle of life but the fact thatyou have a connection to scotland yard besides your criminal activitiesobviously a past connection since you have crossed the line to the otherside of the law     shes a sharptongued one isnt she he says to wells     just a good judge of character wells replies     do you have a name i ask one found on police ledgers andwanted posters     he laughs—a rather unpleasant grating sound on my nerveseverything about this man gets my teeth clenching the way they did when iheard fingernails on blackboards in school     looks to me like the pots calling the kettle black dont you thinkhere you two are wanted all over the kingdom for murder and other highcrimes—     and treason im sure i throw in     especially that poor artist who got an ice pick in his back     own an ice pick i ask     he shakes his head and looks to wells for help i can see the womanhas mistaken me for a whitechapel boy my names archer detectivearcher     id like to see your badge i ask knowing the answer     another coarse laugh erupts from him so would i but you see dollybird i gave up my official police position to enter the trade as a consultingdetective like the one that writer gent you went visiting scribbles about     i exchange looks with wells it isnt necessary to push the issue it isobvious that the mans change of careers wasnt voluntary and that he hasmanaged to keep good track of us     from what ive heard from my police friends you two are a regularjesse james and belle starr why if i called over the innkeeper and toldhim to send for the constable id have a fat reward and you two would findyourselves on the wrong side of bars     hes lying about the reward but he isnt bluffing about the constablehe will turn us over to the police if we dont give him what he wants     you obviously want something from us fine tell us what youreafter and what hailey wrote in her diary and well share our informationwith you why dont we start with who hired you     my isnt she a spirited lass he says to wells the kind a man likesto tame with the whip he carries that women love to get a beating from     wells springs from his chair listen you disgusting lout—     please i put a restraining hand on wellss arm people at anothertable have turned to look at us i smile and tug at his arm smile wedont want to attract attention     wells sits down but hes red in the face he gives archer a grin thatlooks more like a wolf sneering     he has the upper hand i look at wells he knows it but he wantsour help or he would have already turned us in turning back to the lout isay i dont take offense at your vulgar manners mr… what did you sayyour name was     archer thats what im called     mr archer i am sure that inappropriate language is the least bit offoul behavior i can expect from a man i first encountered when he muggedme on a public street as for the name of your employer we know its lordwinsworth which means we have a common goal     even as i speak the words it strikes me that this man isnt just workingfor winsworth but is grinding his own ax too the fact im sure he hadpreviously betrayed his police employers enough to lose his badge is anindication that he has all the honor of a gnat in a garbage can     lets get down to business i tell him tell us what hailey wrote inher diary     no love well play the game my way you tell me what you knowand i wont call for the constable     we have a stalemate that can last forever and wont do either of usany good is my reply we are willing to share information with you onlyup to a point because if we tell you everything you want to know youllturn us over to the constable as soon as were finished     you have my word of honor     wells bursts out with a guffaw and i give him a warning look we havethe same opinion of archers capacity for honor but i dont want to attractattention from the other diners or turn him completely against us     i lock eyes with our uninvited dinner companion mr archer youdont have to ask the landlord to call the constable im going to do itmyself and have you arrested a woman you nearly knocked down duringyour attack on me can easily confirm you are the attacker by providing thelocal police with a description of you     you are a tough one arent you he reaches into an inside pocket ofhis suit coat and brings out haileys diary and puts it on the table but keepshis big paw on it now tell me what i get for telling you what you want toknow     you get to follow closely behind as we take each step     both men stare at me a bit amazed and im surprised myself becausei dont know where the notion came from it just slipped out my tonguegoes liquid sometimes when im in need of an escape route     come again archer says     its elementary my dear archer you have been following us becauseyou have no leads yourself you must realize that we are closing in that wenow know where dr lacroix is what i am offering is to tell you our nextstep in exchange for information from you you can join us or preferablysince its how we have been successfully operating up to now you canfollow closely behind we can make use of your skills as a police officer iadd deliberately omitting the former from his police status when webring dr lacroix to bay      archer looks to wells and shakes his head in wonderment did i justhear this woman who is minutes away from being in police chains tell mei could follow her around      wells leans closer to archer and speaks in a confidential tone ill letyou in on a secret ive been following in her footsteps for days and if itwasnt for her bloodhound nose id still be going in circles      we know where lacroix is i say and we will lead you there aslong as you share information      i also know where the man is tell me where you think he is—just soi can see how much youre bluffing      archer is lying of course if he knew where lacroix was we wouldntbe having this conversation      mr wells did research for lacroix i decide to humor him heknows the man set up a laboratory in dartmoor not the continent      archer smacks his lips where in dartmoor      ignoring the question i continue lady chilcott gave me the clue thatled me to the artist so did a prostitute in bath who died rathermysteriously soon afterward i pause for a moment for effect to see ifthere is any reaction in his face about the prostitute nothing i continuebefore he was murdered the artist gave us another lead earlier today allthe pieces to the puzzle came together      you visited that detectivestory writer dropped by to see him myselfnot a very friendly gent considering how much me and him got incommon      which translates as dr doyle refused to discuss our visit with himthe only thing archer and dr doyle have in common is that they bothbreathe air and im sure archers fouls the atmosphere when exhaled      you dont know where lacroix is we do i repeat and we knowwhat evidence to look for—not only for the death of lady winsworth butthat of a child      the prostitutes kid      murdered      vampires archer exclaims                                     49archer laughs at the surprised look on our faces     dont know everything do you     i dont ask him to elaborate about the vampires because i know hewont no doubt he had thrown out the word as both a boast and as bait tosee what we would say to his statement     he slaps his palm on the table lets go back to the question thatswings back and forth over us like a hanged man on a gallows—where islacroix     a place where we will ultimately lead you to     he gets up from his chair sticking the diary back into the inside pocketof his coat im sending for the constable     i turn to wells well have the innkeeper also send for dr doyle ashe said hed speak to the authorities if we have any difficulties he canmake sure the woman in london anne carson who saw you attack me iscontacted he hadnt exactly said that but im certain he would annecarson is the name of my favorite grammar school teacher it slid off mytongue when i needed a name for the woman since i failed to ascertain hers     waving archer away like a pest i tell him i dont react well topeople who bully me ill have plenty to talk about to the constable when hegets here im certain hell have a number of questions not just for you butfor your employer when i tell him about london by the way i hope youremployer still plans to pay you even though he will be arrested as anaccomplice for your crime     then with my sweetest smile i end with but i wonder what lordwinsworth will say when he reads in the papers about how his hired thugbrought criminal charges and scandal to his door if he lives up to hisreputation hell have your tongue cut out and fed to his parrot     archer bursts out with that nervegrating laugh of his and sits backdown slamming his palm back on the table by god i declare if i didnthave my detecting career keeping me so busy id take the time to show thissaucy woman what shed think about in her dreams tonight      you mean in her nightmares wells says beating me to the line      archer pulls out a cigar cuts off the tip wets the end by popping it inand out of his mouth like a sucker then lights it and leans back with asatisfied expression      i glance at wells barely able to hold back a crack that archer is aboutto tell us something but not until he is puffed up and stage center so wellappreciate how clever he is      your reporter friend was infatuated with dr lacroix fell madly inlove with him at first sight wrote down her most passionate feelingsdetailing what she experienced for the doctor from the moment she methim sort of the corny romantic trite youd expect to hear from muchyounger girls in the throes of puppy love      even though i dont doubt that is what hailey wrote it breaks my heartto hear it my fear has been that she had become overly impressed withlacroix not only because of whatever sales pitch he gave her about hisvisions for helping mankind but his appeal to women especially one whoreaches out to help a woman look and feel more attractive      her immaturity and inexperience in dealing with men in a romanticvein would have made her easy prey for lacroix      not being able to resist the temptation i ask a question i know willonly feed his ego when he refuses to answer      what did you mean when you spoke of vampires      itll shock you down to your pretty little toes love but thatll have towait until you and i get to know each other better      shes not going to get to know you any better wells says hotlyshe may trust you to travel with us but i dont im wiring lordwinsworth and will warn him to call off his dog or he can join you in jail      archer lets out a hohoho laugh as he blows cigar smoke in wellssface      i dont think your demand to lord winsworth will have much weightcoming from one of his servants whos been bobbing his wife      wells turns a deep red and archer leans forward to further impale him      his lordship found those love letters you sent off to his wife thankinher for the money and babbling like another lovesick puppy about howmuch you enjoyed those pleasurable moments with her if his wife had beenbedding down with a gentleman it wouldnt have been so disgusting but toknow she laid with a domestic—     shut up i snap at archer one more word out of you and i will callthe constable     wells is rigid and almost purple im sure hes about to attack the muchstronger man not only getting a beating in return but ruining our entiremission please i whisper to him please dont strike out at him thatswhat he wants hes baiting you please for me and for lady winsworthand for that little girl go up to the room     he rises slowly never taking his eyes off of archer his fists clenchedi am in awful suspense because im certain he is ready to leap on the man     dont i warn archer as he takes the cigar out of his mouth to makeanother crack     wells slowly walks away stiffly but with dignity     as soon as wells disappears up the stairs i turn to the thug mrarcher i do hope that after this is all over you will visit me in new york     he gives me a smirking leer you like a man who handles himselfdont you     actually i think what you did to my friend was disgusting thereason id like to have you visit is because theres a bareknuckles champ iwant to have knock all your teeth out     i get up and smooth my dress well leave here after breakfast in themorning were taking the ten oclock train to exeter once we reachexeter ill tell you the next phase     he eyes me with suspicion if youre planning to take a train whydyou load up a carriage     to haul to the station i didnt want to take the time to buy supplies inexeter where the police might be interested in us well rent anothercarriage there for the next leg     were going back to linleighinthemoor that artist told you morethan youre letting on     that artist told us more than im willing to tell you and you knowmore than youre telling me so we both have our secrets when i feel thatyouve been fair with us i will share more with you     his features twist into a mean sneer you had better be careful i dontmind a bit of wordplay back and forth but i expect results if i dont getthem from you youre not going back home as pretty as you came hesmirks you can let that boyfriend of yours know that the next time hefaces me ill cut off his balls and have them fried for dinner      even though i am trembling with anger and disgust i control myvoice see you at nine in the morning or should we make our way to thestation separately in case lacroixs people are looking for us      he chews on that for a moment separately he jabs his cigar at mebut dont think you can lose me ive caught up with you before and if ihave to do it again i wont be my gentle self      im trembling with fear      with a stiff back and head held high i head for the steps not givinghim one ounce of satisfaction that he has frightened me which he mighthave just a little what he has really done is anger me and i hope iveshown that      my heart is heavy for wells he has been stripped of his dignity andhis secret life even worse for a proud man it was in front of a womanhow devastated he must be feeling right now i wish i had someplace elseto go he needs time and privacy to sort his emotions and he definitelydoesnt need to see me      never have i seen a friend more defeated than when archermaliciously slashed with what appears to be the awful truth the domesticclass a servant that is mind boggling since he is both a teacher and ascientific researcher      england has a very structured society based upon money and bloodthe more the money or the bluer the blood the more doors are opened thesame is true in america but to a much lesser degree—there its mostly justa question of the size of ones bank account      hopefully my news to wells that we will not be seeing archers faceagain will cheer him up      despite what i said to archer i have no intention of being around inthe morning to take the exeter train                                      50wells is standing at the window staring out when i enter he has taken offhis coat collar and top shirt to prepare for bed he doesnt turn to look atme and i know he is hiding his embarrassment about the revelations archerspit out so viciously      quietly i close the door behind me and go to him putting my hand onhis arm and turning him to me his features are grave with a grim set likemost men he considers it a weakness to reveal his hurt      i caress his cheek with my fingers and brush his lips with mine hislips open as i press mine against him and we melt together in a long warmkiss      embedded female instincts make me break away      i find you to be a strange man in wonderful ways herbert georgewells you are the most intelligent man i have ever sparred with      ah … so you will love me for my mind but…      i do admire you for your fine mind … but if i am to love you it willbe because i sense that beneath the intellect is great passion not just for lifebut for me      i look away trying to organize my thoughts for what i am about to sayis against all ive been taught its been a struggle but ive come to realize iam a woman who has desires and needs and yet i dont want to get marriedat least not right now however i am not always able to lock away myfeelings or desires nor do i want to      i have to give you fair warning i tell him i have fought long andhard to find a path in this world i will never give up my freedom for a man—any man the love i give today will still be in me tomorrow but my bodywill be an ocean away      i expect nothing less from you miss nellie bly      he turns to look out the window to give me privacy as i remove myjacket and my blouse i dont sleep in my outer clothes because they wouldbecome horribly wrinkled but my underclothes are significantly modestthe type a woman would not be embarrassed for her father and brothers tosee her in he speaks to the window as i undress      society has such ridged rules and laws that inhibit people fromadvancing and being what they want to be as a woman you cannot voteor be equal to a man in work and love i as a man am enslaved into aposition in life because i was born into it an accident of birth like a kingexcept the benefits are a bit less      as hes talking i have my back to him as i hang my clothes and brushthem out      what did you and archer talk about after i left      we played cat and mouse about what information he was to give forwhat i gave in return it ended up a stalemate i asked him about hisvampire remark and got the expected evasiveness      he turns back around we can hope that one of those vampires hekeeps talking about will bite him      he obviously knows but it makes no difference he is so instinctivelydishonest and deceitful no matter what we cant rely upon anything he tellsus      you realize that when we find lacroix the greatest danger will be aknife in our backs by archer hes not going to want to share the credit      from what ive seen of the man before turning lacroix over to hisemployer archer will have a bidding war to see who will pay him themost      he leans back against the wall and stares at me not impolitely or withlust but with tenderness      i thought about archer making a deal with lacroix too i make busywith the clothes fighting my feelings resisting the fiery urge i feel in myentire body dealing with him will be a lost cause no matter how we goabout it      once again i turn my back to him wondering how am i going tohandle this      you are an incredible woman nellie bly      thank you… is all i can barely say      i feel his warm breath behind me on my neck and my will powervanishes      i am going to make love to you nelliei know                                    51archer ordered his third double shot of whiskey at the inns bar he wasfeeling good after the conversation with the reporter and her teachercompanion in the morning hed get off a wire to his employer and tell hislordship that he was making great progress and that he needed the pumpprimed with more money      his nibs wont be satisfied with archers bare statement of coursefor some reason that delighted archer and he chuckled to himself no trustleft in this world and he could testify to that he ceremonially saluted hiswhiskey to no one but himself and slugged it down the booze wasspreading good cheer in his mind and body      he had needed something to tell winsworth that would impress himenough to loosen the notoriously tight grip the baronet kept on his hoard ofsouth african gold now he could claim he was closing in on lacroix buthe knew winsworth would wire back and want details—ones that archerdidnt have yet but was sure were in the bag      another the bartender asked archer      keep them coming      archer mulled over the conversation he had had with the two amateurdetectives that was how he thought of them himself being a professionalwho once carried a badge that american reporter is a dandy to be sureshe trusted no one smart girl but too smart for her own good this gavehim another chuckle he had to admit she was a good judge of hischaracter      she hadnt revealed much but neither had he though he had whettedher appetite for information with his remark about vampires he wasconfident that they were onto where lacroix was hiding out the laboratoryhad been the key all along now he had to get the information out of her …better yet wait until they have lacroix cornered and then he can take careof business all around      lord winsworth knew a lab existed in dartmoor because his latemissus had told him there was one fortunately for archers ownpocketbook she hadnt told her husband where in dartmoor making itnecessary for him to hire archer      he jerked down the whiskey and tapped the glass on the bar to signalfor another he was feeling good too bad the inn didnt have any womenfor hire      ah… he got it he knew what he would prime the pump with to getmore quid out of his lordship hell tell winsworth that a child had sufferedthe same fate as his wife      he mulled over how he would code the wire to his employer to conveylacroix killed a kid too without raising cain at the telegraph office      he wondered why a man with as much gold as the baronet was sostingy about spending it one thing was for certain once he uncoveredlacroixs secret place lord winsworth would be giving him plenty moremoney a fistful—before he revealed the location that thought drew a deepsinister laugh from archer      hed gotten no instructions from his employer as to exactly what theplan was once lacroix had been located winsworth knew as well as he didthat there was no real evidence to tie a crime around the doctors neckmaybe with time and money winsworth could pull it off but the baronetdidnt strike him as a patient man      finding a way to get an even bigger wad out of the situation had beenbrewing within archer ever since he found the diary that would requiretaking another step forward after finding lacroix      he had asked winsworth what the game would be once he collaredlacroix and the man had stared at him for a moment and then said welldeal with that at the right time and place      the correct place and time for archer was one in which he got paideven more than he had been promised      if lacroix suffered an accident rather than being dragged into a slowand uncertain justice from the courts archer had a feeling that his potwould become much much bigger winsworth was the kind of mine ownerwho wasnt afraid to call in strike breakers to crack a few heads and waswilling to have a union leader pulled out of his home in the middle of thenight and hanged      of course the other side of the coin was to see what lacroix had tooffer in order to make a getaway     archer was about to tap for another whiskey when a man slipped upnext to him and said let me get this one     the man tapped the counter twice with his own empty glass he wasabout thirty with a heavy build     my thanks if this stranger wanted to get him a drink fine witharcher he bought many a drink for other pub patrons when he was in thechips     i could tell you are a fellow londoner just by the way youredressed the man said thought we might chat hard to pick up aconversation with these local yokels dont ya think     the innkeeper walked by pleased that the two men were drinkingwhiskey rather than cheap ale he took them to be a couple of salesmenfrom the city bristol or london probably     odd though he thought the one who had just bellied up to the barnext to the other man was wearing a type of shoe hed never seen beforemight even be boots it was hard to tell because the upper part was hiddenunder the mans pant leg     the pointed toes of the footwear is what threw him off it made theboots look uncomfortable                                     52we lay together wells on his back my head on his chest i feel morerelaxed more focused than i did when i arrived back in our room afterverbally dueling with archer      i have been running mentally and almost physically basically fromthe second i learned of haileys death shortly before that i had been racingbreathlessly around the world to beat a record that existed only in theimagination of jules verne my body and mind have been in high gearfor … well since i got my job with pulitzer at the world      a thought comes to me—the woman at the spa in bath showing mehow they help women release their female hysteria and how important itis so this is the end result i cant help but smile      im sorry wells whispers      what are you talking about      im sorry i didnt punch that ass in the jaw he would have finishedme off proper but not before i got in one or two      and for certain the innkeeper would have called the constable and wewould be in jail right now or out in the streets without a room either wayyou were right in leaving besides we needed to string him along and findout what he knows he baited us again with that vampire thing i am justsorry he tried to insult you      the worst part about his probes is that it was all true my parents aredomestics and they once worked at the winsworth estate lady winsworthtook an interest in me i—i came to be fond of her      you loved her      i loved her for what she was a kind generous and intelligentwoman she was beautiful in mind and soul i was am infinitely gratefulfor her help and support her husband is a tyrant who cares nothing for herexcept as a display piece in his collection of art and fine furnishings      winsworths extremely rich which i imagine for her made up for agreat many of his shortcomings      he was a mining engineer who struck it rich as much from luck asskill as those things usually are he bought himself a title and now thinksof himself as the cock of the walk hes insufferable to be around hedoesnt talk to people he talks down to them my parents didnt stay long intheir service because he constantly yelled the last straw was when he wentinto a fit of rage over a maid breaking a vase and threw a broken piece ather as she was trying to clean it up      i have a hunch that part of wellss feelings toward lady winsworthwere in the vein of a knight in shining armor i could tell he is being evasiveabout his relationship with the woman and being the person i am i want toknow      were you lovers      we—we found comfort in each others arms just once she had cometo me after her husband slapped her for some transgression or another soshe said i imagined he was just in a bad mood and took it out on her hehad a habit of doing that i had suffered an injury and was emotionallydistraught over life over the struggle to be something more than thedrapers apprentice that i was headed for it was my dear mothers wish thati become one a much better position in life than hers she constantly toldmy bothers and me i saw it as a life of servitude      he kisses me on the forehead i did write her some letters that gushedwith passion and gratitude im not a hopeless romantic but i see nothingwrong in showing emotions may i remind you that you are a bird that willfly off to your next story or your next adventure well in a sense im nodifferent i do not believe i will ever give my love to a single woman for alltime i find that unhealthy and stressful just as i would imagine it would befor a woman i am polygamous like that religious sect in utah conandoyle wrote about in his first sherlock holmes book i believe in free lovenot love that is smothering      this is a conversation i dont want to partake in at least not right nowafter ive just finished making love with the man all i know is that i am awoman who has been raised in a very strict society—especially for womenits hard for me to grasp his free love theory but i do know that i am notpolygamous i dont believe in sharing its just not for me and i feel its adisrespectful way to treat your mate if wells is fine with it thats hischoice and i just hope he finds a woman who has similar feelings      but now it is time for me to put aside love and what i want out of lifeat least for the moment there are more important things to concentrate oni slip off the bed and start getting dressed      there ive driven you away with my babbling forgive me i truly dolove—      get dressed its time to go      he stares at me and then looks to the window before stating theobvious      its nighttime dark outside      yes it usually is about eleven oclock in the evening everywhereim told except those places that enjoy the midnight sun      i grab his pants off the chair and toss them to him      we have to get out of here when archer isnt looking      were not teaming up with him      of course not whatever gave you that idea      he gets off the bed and starts hopping into his pants i suppose ishould have known you were lying you do it so well but pray tell sweetnellie shouldnt we wait until the crack of dawn to sneak out      archer is not a stupid man i think about that statement more slylike a fox than bright i suppose and the fox in him will tell him wellmake a getaway about the time the sun is rising i told him wed meet himafter breakfast but im sure he took that with a grain of salt      we continue dressing as we chat      you dont believe that there is any advantage in teaming with himwells asks remember theres a killer out there archer is an expoliceman and im sure he can handle himself he may even have a gun      if he has one hell probably end up using it on us and yes imsorely tempted to team up with him but i also keep reminding myself thathe smacks of criminality starting with the mugging i got from him peopletend to stay consistent in life criminals tend to commit more crimes thatmeans we can never trust him and will always have to be watching ourbacks worse when he does betray us we may be defenseless      what about the diary it may have more information      i dont want to be clutching for the diary with my dying breath and ihave a feeling it will end up that way if we let him lead us around with itlike a donkey with a carrot besides i dont believe he has much more totell us from the diary what he told me about haileys infatuation withlacroix rang true hailey was immature in many ways and dealing with aman in a romantic situation is just one of them but she apparently wrotenothing in the diary about how to find lacroix or where his laboratory inthe moors is if she had archer wouldnt need us      quite but as im sure you are aware of we are only going to shakehim temporarily hell find us again and hell still have the diary youll stillhave an opportunity to find out if there is any more to grasp from it      i give a bit of thought to the idea of running into archer after we runout on him he doesnt strike me as a particularly forgiving man      my dear wells i do believe that our next meeting with mr archerwill not be on a friendly basis      point taken      what i dont convey and he knows as well as i do is that we shall belucky just to get away and stay away from the man long enough to findlacroix                                    53we had left our purchases for the trip with the buggy at the stable so wedidnt have to haul anything more from our room than our valises     after were dressed we pack up our clothes for a quick escape     as quietly as possible i open the door a crack and check the hallway tomake sure the coast is clear there are only eight rooms four on each sideof the hallway with a set of steps at each end since i dont know whichroom is archers or even if he has returned to his room i hesitatewondering which direction we should take     for all i know he could still be in the bar below and if he is he mightsee us going out the front because the exit passes by the doubledooropening to the bar     to my left the hallway leads to the stairs that would take us backdownstairs and through the lobby past the hotels small front desk and thewide doors to the pub     to the right is a set of stairs that im guessing leads to a rear door     our room is already paid for so we dont have to stop at the frontdesk     well go out the back i whisper to wells     as we hurry down the hallway i cant resist the temptation to glanceback and see if archers head is poking out of a doorway it isnt     the hallway is dimly lit with gaslights at each end the stairway is adark pit and we have to watch our footing going down     at the bottom of the stairs we get an unpleasant surprise—the reardoor is locked bolted tight it takes a key to get out     damn wells hits the door should have guessed keeps peoplefrom running out on their rent     i dont suppose you learned how to pick a lock from one of thosebooks you read     wells shakes his head only cutting up salamanders     then we have no choice well have to risk going out the front      in that case i think we should wait a couple of hours until after thebar closes archer struck me as the type that hangs around to the very endwe call them pub closers      we cant the stable will be closed the stablemans not going to behappy and if we wait any later he wont answer the bell period besidesits already dark and its getting foggy we need to make our way to anotherinn before it gets worse      and what is your plan if he catches us redhanded      well pretend were coming to see him      with our luggage      we tell him we have to leave now because were afraid the police arecoming but stopped by to tell him where were headed      amazing…      what      how you do it he walks down the dimly lit first floor hallwayshaking his head      do what      come up with these lies      i dont volunteer that i doubt that archer would fall for the lie but itwill at least give him pause      wells is ahead of me and he is going by the open door to the menswater closet when he comes to an abrupt halt      good lord      what whats the matter i rush up beside him      archer is sitting on a toilet motionless dead      oh … my … lord…      the handle of an ice pick is sticking out his right ear blood is runningdown the side of his neck he is staring straight ahead blankly dull eyedthe expression on his face is one of permanent surprise      we have to keep going i give wells a push      we start to rush away when i stop the diary we have to get thediary      i turn back and go in my whole body shaking i slowly approacharchers body he appears to be staring directly at me and i almost lose mynerve giving out a slight yelp i reach inside his coat where id seen himput the diary      its not there      i pad his chest to find it nothing his weight shifts and he starts to fallforward this time i cry out and push him back      wells grabs my arm and pulls me out of the room he closes the doorand turns the sign on the outside from unoccupied to occupied      its not there i tell wells as we move quickly down the hallway thediary archer stole and so blatantly boasted possession of had cost himdearly      my knees are trembling and im afraid they will give out but i forcemy feet ahead with sheer willpower      just before we come out of the hallway i stop      we need to compose ourselves      once we get our breathing in order we move forward at a speed i hopedoesnt look like we are running from a fire—or a murder      we pass through the dining room and as we go by the open doors tothe bar i pause and look in my eyes automatically go to the shoes of menlooking for cowboy boots thank god i dont see a pair because i dontknow what id do      as we head for the exit the innkeeper whos behind the front desklooks up from an accounting book and asks are you leaving      mothers sick wells says must rush to her bedside were takingthe train      you wont be getting a refund on your room stay a minute stay thewhole night its same to me      thank you i respond inanely and then realize im not supposed tosay anything because of my accent      the stable is half a block away and it is everything i can do to keepfrom breaking into a run but even running would not have gotten us thereany quicker than the swift stride wells sets out for us      we get lucky—the stableman is working late to make repairs on acarriage wheel our buggy is still loaded and the ponies are quicklyharnessed      as we come out of the stable yard a man bursts out of the hotel andruns down the street away from us its the innkeeper      going for the constable wells says change of course      he quickly steers the ponies in the opposite direction      please tell me you have an idea of where we are going      no but im sure that somewhere ahead will be a road that can take usnorth      i know we will get lost i just feel it but there are no other options thanto head out blindly      we wander for a while trying to find the road without finding theconstable first its an hour before we reach a simple wood sign at acrossroad that says poundsgate and has an arrow pointing left we haventpassed an inn      wells and i exchange looks no words are needed the only certaintyabout turning left is that we will leave a small town for a long poorlymaintained road with few accommodations on it but if we continuestraight were certain wed end up at the train station      taking a train back to london is tempting we could leave all thischaos behind wells would return to teaching and i could catch a ship backto new york      i dont think we will be able to make out what is ahead on the road istated the obvious      my rational mind knows that probably little will change in terms of thescenery of the moors after we leave ashburton but the part of my brain thatsometimes imagines the unimaginable tells me that the night has growndarker the fog thicker the road more deserted      maybe we should pull over and wait til morning im still trying toput off the inevitable      and let the constable find us … i dont think so      when you and dr doyle were perusing routes for us to take did hetell you anything about poundsgate      a small but comfortable inn good ale and the devil      why does that not surprise me is the dark one the innkeeper      giving equal credit to each sex for evil im not certain satan is a heas opposed to a she but we can refer to him as a he to keep thingssimple      just tell me about the devil its cold its dark its creepy and imsure there are things out here that would give pause to satan himself      its said that the devil stopped at the poundsgate inn on his way tocollect a soul in widecombe which is farther north      how did the innkeeper know it was the devil      his cloven heels were a tipoff he was dressed in black and rode ablack horse as he downed a mug of ale all in one long chug the barmaidheard a hissing sound he left money on the bar that appeared to be coinsbut turned out to be dried leaves when she picked them up the mug he seton the bar left a scorch mark after he left the bar he found the man whosesoul hed come for at church services in widecombe he collected the manafter causing damage and a death or two in the church      other than the cloven hooves and his bad bar manners is thereanything to corroborate the visit of the dark one or can we just attribute itas another old wives tale      there is the matter of the ball lightning      which is      our image of lightning is of long narrow flashes there is a rarevariety which appears as a fiery ball the earliest know verification of balllightning happened that day when a ball of fire went through a churchwindow and wreaked havoc at widecombe      cloven hooves ball of fire it was good enough for me      no rest for the wicked wells states flatly      i wish you hadnt put it that way      we turn left heading for the wild moors      it occurs to me that lefthandedness has always been associated withthe devil                                     54the moors … the dark side of the moon as far as im concerned      on this chilly foggy gloomy night with just the ghost of a full moonsailing through a sea of ashen clouds our dartmoor ponies somehowmanage to maneuver down a dark dirt road without breaking a leg an axle      mr poe genius of the horror and the macabre could hardly haveimagined a night with more unseen but felt terrors the most frighteningelement of all is that we can see so little we have no idea of what liesbefore us and i mean right before us everything is shrouded distorted bydense fog the effect is otherworldly nothing which i have experiencedbefore      i look at wells whose eyes are trying to focus on the dirt road ahead ifeel like we have entered into the dartmoor mist you were telling meabout      quit is all he says his back is ridged and his hands grip the reinstightly as he leans forward trying to focus on what lies ahead      what my eyes dont see my mind imagines—which is nothing goodnor does my imagination stop flaring up with the landscape—images of theblack beast of a hound are conjured in my head every time i hear the howlof a farmers dog the ice pick killer on his horse whenever somethingappears to move in the dark on occasion there is the eerie howl of a houndthat sends quivers up my spine and causes me to edge closer to wells      we should have bought a gun wells says      should have would have could have but we bought a compass itry to say in a cheerful voice      wonderful we can ward off demons and murderers by leading themin the wrong direction      wellss attempt at humor does nothing for either of us      instead just the mention of demons and murderers brings horribleimages to my mind i keep seeing the ice pick in weekess back and the onein archers head the ice picks are left as a boast and a trademark wellsconcluded earlier       which brings up a question—what direction has the ice pick killertaken       if lacroix is in okehampton and the murderer is returning to his nesthe could be taking the direct route across the moors just as we have couldhe be on horseback i regret not asking the stableman if another man hadpicked up his horse shortly before we arrived he could have headed out inany direction—especially ours since he has now twice appeared at thesame location as we have       is he following us i ask wells or are we on his heels       it takes him a moment to realize who im talking about       he … or … they he asks why must we assume there is only oneif it is the whitechapel gang there may be more of them out there       out there of course included where we are       the ice pick and cowboy boots serve a number of purposes for thelondon gang he continues its a trademark and a boast making it easierto intimidate people but what if in our case its also a red herring       something to throw us off       throw suspicion on the whitechapel bunch and direct the police andus to look for the wrong person       thank you wells a moment ago i was watching out for a killer withan ice pick and cowboy boots now i have to worry about everyone on theplanet       theres an edge of humor to my remark but there is nothing funnyabout the situation while i had not found archer to be the most admirableor finest specimen of humanity he didnt deserve to die nor did the artistweekes who seemed like a pleasant fellow who just wanted to enjoy lifeand paint       why not us too i ask wells he—they—wanted to keep the artistfrom revealing the location and wanted the diary from archer is it just acoincidence that they were killed after talking to us or did we lead the killerto them       perhaps both wells readjusts his body on the wooden buggy seatif it is the whitechapel gang theres probably more than one involvedthey could have been following both us and archer       wait i just remembered when we talked to the shopkeeper inlinleighonthemoor he said something about strangers in town i wassure he was referring to us and only one other person because he talkedabout the stranger with the fullsized horse i didnt think anything of itbecause i assumed that anyone we had to fear would be following us and noone had passed us on the way      you think the killer got there before us because lady chilcott spilledthe beans      yes im sure of it now but that still doesnt answer why they haventtried to kill us yet      theres an answer as to why they havent attacked you wellssvoice seems to be relaxing a bit maybe its because were talking instead ofsitting in silence letting the ghostly thoughts and images feed ourimaginations      a couple deaths in small dartmoor towns are a tragedy hecontinues but they will not be a national issue the police could evenconsider them random killings by some sick bastard who kills whenever hegets the opportunity but the murder of a famous american reporter wouldcause a sensation and an intense investigation especially since youve madeit obvious to the police in both london and bath that you suspect lacroixand the spa in the death of your friend      he leans against me and gives me a kiss on the cheek but killing ateacher wouldnt even raise an eyebrow in london stay close to me imsafer when youre around      an unpleasant thought strikes me you might not be completely rightabout being safe with me we are on an isolated road where no one can hearour screams and he can easily get rid of our bodies in a bog … never to befound again      the unnerving thought that we have put ourselves at the mercy of thekiller makes my heart jump up to my throat      i wonder what it would be like to slip down—way down—in peat ilook at wells they say its not cold beneath the surface that it generatesits own heat sometimes smoldering for years and even starting forest firesso on the brighter side if our bodies were thrown into a bog wed bedown there for thousands of years until someone dug us out and put us in amuseum wed be preserved forever      i think the mistfog is affecting your brain wells pats my leg ifyou keep this up im turning this buggy around and heading back forashburton      i glance to our rear dont he may be following us or…      nellie—      i have to say it or ahead of us we could be trapped      on that charming thought we grow silent drawing into our ownthoughts      the bumpy road makes for very slow going and unfortunately plentyof time to think which right now i dont want to do all my thoughts arenegative      are we lost i finally ask wells      no      how can you be so sure in all this fog      he takes a deep breath the compass has us going in a generallynorth direction      but the way the road twists and turns i would think it would make thecompass hard to set even for a generally northern course one momentwere going north and the next east or west its too dark to see anything onthe horizon to help steady out the course or decide which fork in the road totake      good point      so…      i agree wells looks at me tired we have no idea where we are      terrific—wait is that a farmhouse      a home materializes in front of us and we hear the howls of dogs andthe telltale ratchet of a doublebarrel shotgun being loaded      wells … did you hear that      yes…      whos out there comes the nervous voice of a man      dont shoot i shout were lost in the fog      a moment of silence then your voice dont sound right to me      im an american      and im british—herbert george wells from london we weremaking our way to widecombe but our compass has led us to a dead end      we hear the crunch of footsteps and a man comes into view hescarrying a shotgun and wearing a woolen cap and a fulllength nightshirt                                     55farmer hayes raises sheep on the rugged land and maintains a garden thatprovides enough for himself and a little left over to sell at market day      the small farmhouse he has invited us to stay the night is a stonecottage with a thick gray thatch roof it is much smaller and more roughlyhewed than the old bridge house both inside and out just two rooms abedroom and living room–kitchen      the sink has a hand pump that brings in water from a tank outside thefew pieces of furniture—a small table sideboard two chairs and a largerocking chair heavily padded with wool—are all of wood only finished bytime and smoke from the fireplace when a gust of wind reverses the draft      he does in fact have two delightful companions—two big friendlyold english sheepdogs hansel and gretel they have thick shaggy coatsand long straight hair that drops down over their faces and covers their blueeyes      farmer hayes told us that not only do their shaggy fur coats keep thedogs warm but their undercoats shed water can get four or five pounds ofhair from them every year women weave socks and sweaters from it      the sleeping accommodations are basic—a padded woolen mat infront of the fireplace and a warm quilt with dog hair on it—but after beinglost in the moors and chased by creatures of my imagination i wouldnthave felt more snug at the langham hotel      im a bachelor hayes tells us as he puts a log on the fire had awife once but she couldnt take the solitude said its too lonely for her outhere not too lonely for me any itch i get for people gets satisfied with acouple pints and a game of darts once a week and thats more thanenough      satisfied with the fire he offered us a cup of home brew to keep youwarm but we both politely declined      if my wife had been here when you two came along she would havebeen properly frightened she was superstitious and scared of things thatwent bump in the night      get many strange sightings wells asks      no more than anyone else the black beast is out there but if youleave it alone itll just take a sheep or a horse now and again though somesay it likes the taste of human flesh even better      ever seen it i ask      never had it come up and eat out of me hand if thats what you meanbut you cant have spent your life on the moors without now and againseeing things that make the hair on the back of your neck stand up      amen to that      mr and mrs wells once again lay down together even though weare fully clothed as soon as farmer hayes turns down the lamp and retreatsto his bedroom there will be a bit of necking and petting with thenewlyweds sharing his wool mat      the moment i lay down i am smothered with hot wet kisses and i startgiggling wells too receives attention as both the big dogs flop down nextto us      when hansel and gretel are settled beside us wells leans over andkisses me and then puts a finger on my lips to hush me      i know what youre going to say the dog kisses better                                     56hansel and gretel awaken me as they get up to leave the house with farmerhayes wells is still sound asleep snoring very softly as i lay for a momenthating that i have to get up and go outside to the privy indoor plumbingwhich lacks the cold walk and icy seat of an outhouse is perhaps thegreatest boon to mankind      the fire in the fireplace has died down and now just ashes lingerleaving the room slightly chilly and crisp i see the farmer has left breakfaston the table some bangers and bread and a jug of what people who have towork outside on cold mornings take a swig of to warm their insides      its a gray morning quiet and hazy with the fog not burned off yetafter i endure the privy that blocks of ice could well have been stored in ihear the dogs barking and decide to watch how the famous breed herdssheep      the barking is coming from beyond a small ridge at the end of rows ofcabbage at the top of the ridge i see sheep being herded by one of the dogsover another hill and i can hear the other dog barking      rocks are placed nicely for me to use as stepping stones to cross asmall stream a large green patch of lowlying turf is beyond the creek andi hurry to cross it as the dog and the last sheep disappear over the hill      ive gone no more than four or five steps when i realize the ground isquaking beneath my feet      i stop and freeze in place      the ground feels spongy standing perfectly still for a moment i canfeel the surface trembling underfoot      im on a bog      i thought i was on a patch of grass but its the deceptive greencovering that hides the pond of decaying vegetation      oh god im on thin ice if i step in the wrong spot i will sink      i begin to tremble my heart is pounding and i can feel icy fear racingup the back of my legs and along my spine      help…      my heart has jumped into my throat blocking it and my cry is barelyaudible i give a louder shout for aid but i can hear from the barking thatthe dogs are now far away i dont know how sheep are herded so im noteven sure the farmer is with them      the bog is a flat area surrounded by slopes on all but one side itstrikes me that the ground where the slopes come down might have a gradebeneath the surface that makes it slippery and would cause me to fall i starttaking cautious steps toward the flat area      the surface beneath my feet is soft and wet with an elastic feel as itpresses down under my feet my knees are weak and shaking my breathingshallow as i move slowly afraid that my next step will puncture thisgreenery that covers the bog like the skin of a primeval beast      what did dr doyle say if a bog starts to draw you under dont fightit with your feet lay on it putting as much of the surface of your body onit as you can in order to spread your weight      like floating in water i tell myself if it starts to take me ill float      but its not water its more like quicksand and lying flat may justmake it easier to swallow me      i realize i had been wrong to have continued across i should haveretraced my steps back to the creek back the way i had come withoutsinking instead of venturing on to unknown footing      do i turn around and go back that would require major movementwhich could bring on sinking      do i lay flat and pray someone will come before im swallowedunder      i see something above on the ridge across from where the sheep hadbeen herded its a movement i cant make out any of the details its just adark figure in a patch of fog but im sure its a man on horseback      help im down here help      like the man the horse is just a black shadow in the haze but from itssize it appears to be a fullgrown one not a dartmoor pony i suddenlyfreeze mortified even more with terror—the horse is moving quickly on theridge but i dont hear the sound of its hooves hitting the ground      fear drives me to move      since i have no good choices i take a deep breath im going to make amad dash to the hilly area      my right foot goes down and slips into the muck      i try to pull it out but the bog hangs onto my foot as if id stuck it inthe jaws of an animal                             a bog in dartmoor                                     57a rider all in black a horse that makes no sound wells casts me anappraising look as he hitches the ponies to our buggy im just glad mrhayes realized he forgot to leave out a loaf of bread and a leg of mutton forour journey or…      dont say it i thought my life was over and it would have been if mrhayes wasnt such a kind soul most people would have decided to justcontinue on with their work he saw me before i realized he was therebecause i had my eyes closed but can you imagine the look on his facewhen he came over that ridge and found me trying to be calm lying on abog id laugh but im still too shook up      when i realized the bog wasnt going to let go of my foot i gave inand lay flat as dr doyle recommended it felt that with each breath i tookthe beast was pulling me down just a little each time to torture me afterwhat seemed like forever i heard farmer hayess voice he came runningtoward me with a long pole and pulled me out never in my life was i moregrateful i didnt stop hugging him until he appeared to becomeembarrassed      the dear man saved my life i didnt tell hayes about the phantomand even hesitated about telling wells i had been so frightened on the bogand having heard so many tales of the stranger i fear i might have conjuredit up      you dont believe i saw a dark horseman do you      of course i believe you he tightens a hitch and then turns to mebut i also believe in ghosts and creatures that are only supposed to belongin a childs nightmares in dinosaurs still to be found in a land lost in timeand that the canals of mars were built by an advanced civilization      he gives me a peck on the cheek im just happy that the darkhorseman you saw was his satanic majesty and not the ice pick killer doyou realize you beat the widow maker      i nod my head im just happy the devil isnt ready for me yet      but maybe it is a warning      after going back into the farmhouse to say our last goodbye tofarmer hayes and hansel and gretel we make good time en route towidecombe      as our buggy rumbles along and goes over every bump and dip in thedirt road i want to scream out in pain as my body comes into contact withthe wood seat but i dont i keep watching our valiant ponies pulling usalong uncomplaining avoiding falling into a bog      doesnt the cold damp morning air remind you of the sea i askwells hoping a conversation will keep my mind off my aches and pains      quit      so much for conversation but i cant blame him hes focusing on theroad ahead      the sun is out and has burned off most of the fog but there is a thinhaze that gives the tors in the distance an unearthly feel since dartmoor ispart of englands west country peninsula and lies between two great bodiesof water the english channel and the bristol channel they get a lot of fogmist and haze which lends to a very spooky atmosphere      we pass through widecombe and stop for a midday meal and repair aspoke on the buggy wheel then continue on determined to get beyondchagford before we find an inn or a house that accommodates guests      wells i cant stand the silence anymore and need to talk if just tokill time while you went to find out how the repairs on the buggy werecoming along i was told a story by the waitress in the pub she said that onour way to chagford we will pass the grave of an orphan girl her name ismary jay supposedly it was common at the time to give orphan girls thesurname jay anyway whats uncanny about mary jays situation is itsso similar to haileys      hows that      as a teenager mary was sent to a farm to work and became pregnantby a farmhand some say it was rape others say she was simply so youngand inexperienced she didnt know better whatever the cause faced withan unmarried pregnancy and nowhere to turn poor mary jay killed herself      wells looks at me i see what you mean but unfortunately it is acommon story i cant tell you how many stories ive heard about youngsingle girls getting pregnant and then killing themselves      i know but this one gets worse because suicide is considered by thechurch to be a great sin her body was refused burial on consecrated groundand simply buried at a crossroad the locals believed that the intersectingroads would keep her restless soul confused and unable to escape and harmthem      so they can live in peace her body lives in confused hell      exactly but it does have a happy ending about the time i was borngood samaritans had her body removed from the crossroad properlycasketed and put in a simple mound at a pretty sight along the side of aroad ever since she was reburied fresh flowers appear rather miraculouslyat the grave and the locals claim it is the work of pixies if you dont mind igot specific instructions on how to find the grave i want to leave flowers onit      okay but the pixies are already doing that      i know id like to give them a break      as night is falling and we are still on the road im worried that wemade a mistake in passing satisfactory accommodations to put more milesbehind us and complain to wells that i shouldnt have listened to him but igive him a peck on the cheek as we come to an inn      wait here while i go see if they have a room wells hands me thereins as he gets down      as he walks away i know this time there is no question we willregister as man and wife there is no pretense between us we are lovers …what exactly does that mean to me it raises a question—am i in love withherbert wells      i enjoy his company i feel comfortable lying beside him at night and iconfess that he arouses my passions the yearning i have to unite body andsoul with a man but is that love      all in all my emotions and mind are in a state of confusion i have metother men who i felt a deep passion for but my feelings for them were notpowerful enough to alter my path in life though in each case i left a pieceof my heart behind and have warm memories      wells is different      he has many of the same traits of two men i have loved—intelligenceambition moral and physical courage—both of whom were at least twicewellss age women were only a small part of their lives their attentionbeing directed to their careers     probably most significant about these men is that each of them is amans man the joy they get from life is in doing things that men enjoydoing with other men     i am much the same as those men but i have sensed that wells loveswomen with a deep commitment i know his intent is not to commit himselfto any one woman quite the opposite he loves women in general and hasthe capacity to love—and love—and love     while he is no less ambitious than successful men ive known he doesnot isolate himself from the opposite sex rather he celebratescompanionship with women he is more content to have a romantic dinnerwith a woman than playing a sporting event or solving the worlds problemsover brandy and cigars he is a womans man     all set wells hops back into the buggy lets freshen up beforegoing to the pub     i nod my head so engrossed with my thoughts i didnt see him returni find myself blushing as if he was privy to my mental conversation abouthim                                    did you say you came from ashburton a local at the bar turns and asksus as we are eating     yes comes from both of us     did you spot anything peculiar on the road through the moors     i smother an inclination to tell him id been chased by the devil aswells tells him that everywhere we look on the moors we see somethingpeculiar     that brings chuckles from the man and his companions     isnt that the truth another man says but weve heard sightings ofthe black beast and a sheeps been killed     some say its a wild dog a third companion pipes in but othersclaim what theyve seen is too big to be an ordinary dog     how close have they gotten to what theyve seen wells asks themen      far enough away to still be alive brings a laugh all around      we are no more than a couple hours or so from the okehampton areaso i ask could it be lady howard thats being spotted      no comes from all of them along with shaking of their heads      her ladyship or at least her ghost generally stays nearby the castleone of the locals says besides lady howard is a collector of souls for thedevil shes no sheep killer      can you tell us anything about the castle wells asks them      the men shake their heads as one and say its too far away      the answer doesnt surprise me it is something we have run into allalong—despite the closeness of these men to okehampton none of themhave been to the castle its part of the narrow provincial nature of ruralengland—in america a hundred miles is not a great distance and there areplaces where youd find little in between a hundred miles in englandcovers thousands of years of history and while the language is all calledenglish people not only speak differently than those dozens of miles awaybut often think of themselves as different      wells i whisper in his ear im weary…      do you mind going up by yourself id like to go over the map withthe men      of course… i get up gentlemen i shall say good night its been apleasure talking with you      i head for the cottage in back while wells stays behind      next to a work shack i spot a woodpile perfect im excited mymother always said little things thrill me what thrills me right now is thethought that ill get enough extra wood to keep our fireplace goinghopefully throughout the night when i stoop down to grab some logs i hearfootsteps      thinking it is wells i turn around to tell him what im doing      instead a dark beastly figure is coming at me      aughhhhh escapes my mouth and i grab a piece of wood ready tostrike the great furred monster                                     58good lord nelliegirl that scream will wake up all the ghosts for miles      i dont swoon out but i drop the wood and collapse against oscarsblack fur coat      weve come to storm the castle with you oscar proudly announces      and he didnt just bring himself but his friend dr conan doyle      oscars fur coat answers the rumors about a black beast that is roamingthe moors—his coat is big enough to wrap around me head to toe at leasttwice      knowing oscar loves being the center of attention as we make ourway to the pub i tell him the rumor about a big beast roaming thecountryside      oh my oscar unconsciously covers his teeth as he giggles i can seethe mischievous person in him coming out      not to my disappointment he insists on walking into the inn first withdoyle and i in tow      oscar creates the sort of sensation only oscars mere presence canignite      surrounded by the locals wells our two new arrivals and i sit at atable with a big platter of beef another of the everpresent mutton plusbowls of potatoes vegetables and bread oscar is in heaven the wholeplace is glued to his every word      as we were making our way through the moors i kept thinking aboutlife and how it is a terrible thing for a man to suddenly realize that all hislife he has been speaking nothing but the truth he says in a melodiousvoice      the whole place goes up in laughter and for the first time in a longwhile my spirits are up because as we close in on the enemy—i hope—weare now twice as many      however it does occur to me that the only weapons the four of us haveagainst these coldblooded killers are our words and our brains but imcertain empires have been conquered with no more—though i cant think ofany at the moment      i became concerned after that boorish man showed up at my doordr doyle explains after we got oscar to sit down and stop talking whichquickly dispersed the crowd i assumed you had already started across themoors before he showed up but i went ahead and tried several of the innsin the area to find the two of you but came up blank      we were at an inn near ashburton wells says      i discovered that the next morning when my housekeeper arrivedbursting with the singular news that a murder had been committed with anice pick a check with the police revealed that it was in fact that archerfellow      do they believe we did it im almost afraid to ask      they found out from the innkeeper that the two of you had left inquite a hurry just before the discovery of the body and since they hadalready been on the lookout for an american woman and british gent whohad left a previous location on the heels of a similar crime yes let meassure you that the police are most interested in talking to you however ihave related to them much of what you told me and i believe their interestin you will be focused more on your failure to stay and inform them of whatyou know      my fault entirely i confess because to delay is to fail and return toamerica without my friends murder being solved      im certain that a good result in their investigation from informationsupplied by you will greatly temper their attitude toward you naturally itold them about the cowboy boots and the probable connection to thewhitechapel gang the innkeeper did in fact notice a man with verynarrowtoed boots but unfortunately remembered more about the footwearthan the mans face the police are seeking patrons who were in the pubthat night to see if anyone else saw the killer      a wire from conan after you left his house that said you were kneedeep in some very serious difficulties was my cue to enter stage left oscarsays with all the modesty of a prince of the blood      as it happens he goes on i found myself under some stress arisingfrom a romantic issue in london as the marquis of queensbury a rathersocially inept and disagreeable chap became rather incensed over theattention i was paying to one of his offspring      wells has a puzzled look i thought the marquis had three sons      i notice dr doyle doesnt bat an eye      oscar waves away the triviality whatever i immediately left londonfor buckfastleigh to offer my sword in the battle to come      did you by chance bring the sword wells inquires for we couldcertainly use one      guns and blades are for barbarians my weapons are therighteousness of my cause and the power of my spirit      if someone could be talked to death oscar would be a prime suspectbut i have doubts as to its effectiveness against an ice pick      we werent completely certain that you knew about the killing nearashburton dr doyle intercedes though your hasty departure hadconvinced the local constable that you were indeed involved this secondmurder however threw out any possibility that the linleighonthemoordeath was not connected to your investigation with oscar arriving on theheels of news of archers grisly death we hired a buggy and set outimmediately to find you      i must hope my dear nellie oscar says that the next time i set outto rescue you it will be in a coach with a more comfortable seat than one ofthese carts they call a buggy in dartmoor      amen to that      the conversation shifts to the subject of how we can go about findinglacroixs laboratory dr doyle had devised an investigatory approach as heand oscar set out to find us      i dont believe lacroixs laboratory is at okehampton castle itselfdr doyle tells us i suspect it is in the vicinity but i dont think well findit at the castle despite the fact that its abandoned and generally avoidedbecause of its reputation however its only locals who shy away from theplace in the summer an occasional hiker would venture by so the risk ofexposure would be high      the castle the magic mud bog and the laboratory are all in the samevicinity i inject but that could cover a lot of territory is there anythingabout weekes that would give us a clue as to where the laboratory might belocated he had gone to the area solely to do the painting and probablywasnt that familiar with the terrain himself even though we were told hespent most of his time outside he didnt strike me as someone who wouldhike far      i agree wells says he seemed like a man who limited his physicalactivities i suspect he headed each day for one of those natural granitecaves that form … or maybe he visited a farmers widow but whatever hedid he wouldnt spend the day on his feet      what would you say his excursion on foot to be dr doyle asksan hour … two hours      two hours at the most wells answers      at the very most i add i suspect more like an hour      then lets split the difference and make it an hour and a half at bestnow a person normally walks perhaps three or four miles per hour on a flatsurface so lets assume that because of the roughness of the terrainweekes would have walked at best about two miles per hour an hour and ahalf walk would take him three miles      so the bog is probably within three miles of the castle i exclaim      but six miles to us wells says and dr doyle nods in agreementweekes could have set out in any direction to cover all of them wedhave to draw a circle with a radius of three miles which would leave uswith a diameter of six miles to cover      i get the idea even if i dont understand the terminology once wefind the castle the bog would be three miles from it in any direction      or the laboratory oscar states he might have started from eitherlocation      it never occurred to me that weekes could have been at the laboratorybut it is not out of the question lacroix may have been more tolerant ofhaving a discreet visitor at his laboratory because the painting was donebefore lady winsworth died      this of course assumes our assumptions about weekess energylevel are correct and while covering a threemile radius from the castledoes not seem a daunting task it wont be an easy one either the castle isin an area that has rough terrain and is heavily forested not to mention thethreat of bogs it makes a search time consuming      we need a hot air balloon      there is a stunned silence as the three men stare at me      finally oscar explodes with a great laugh nelliegirl the gods onolympus could not have come up with a better idea      unfortunately i dont believe well find aeronauts and a fleet ofballoons at okehampton dr doyle states grimly      its not impossible wells looks at us somewhat excited i have aninterest in aeronautics because i believe that someday man will conquer thesky with more efficient airships than what we have constructed to date iread recently that since there are no large cities in the region its attractedsome balloon enthusiasts      wait dr doyle sits up i have a friend in okehampton who iattended medical studies with if there is such activity there hell knowabout it      pleased with their revelation dr doyle leans back in his chair andlights his pipe while oscar offers wells one of his cigars      gentlemen if youll excuse me i shall leave you to your brandy andcigars i am going to step out onto the porch for some fresh air      oscar and dr doyle nod their heads in approval and wells courteouslyrises to go with me      i motion for him to sit back down ill be fine its enclosed andothers are about                                    59the porch has a chilly edge to it despite the windows but the air isrefreshing and the oxygen necessary for my brain to continue functioning      a young couple are down at the other end of the deck they arewatching the stars and sneaking kisses and an occasional bit of pettingcomes from the young mans roaming hands      they catch me watching and i quickly turn away i dont want to spoiltheir fun from the corner of my eye i see them coming toward me to leaveand i turn around to address them      please dont leave im going back in      its no problem were going in anyway the young man says itstoo cold out here      he seems embarrassed that i saw them necking but the young girl isblushing and excited were newlyweds she giggles then looks lovinglyat him      congratulations i wish you the best      thank you is said in unison as they leave      im a little sad as i watch them leave not for them but because i amfeeling sorry for myself truth be told im envious of their happiness icant help but wonder if i will ever find that blissful happiness they aresharing right now      right now i cant even find contentment with my job ive tried but icant seem to get settled after my return from dashing around the world myresentment of pulitzer for not being fair with me is a thorn in my claw hetried to keep me from going and wanted to send a man instead but becauseof my determination he let me go and rang the cash register for his papersas i sent circulations soaring yet he still hasnt acknowledged it with athank you in person      because of a contract to write mystery novels and endorse certainproducts i can risk leaving my reporting job but i will miss it its in myblood if only i could do everything i want to do      i take a deep breath and leave the porch im tired of thinking soon ipresume wells will be returning to our cottage and id like to freshen upbeforehand      i am certain oscar will have a clever aside for me when he discoversthat wells and i have become lovers trying to deceive oscar will beimpossible—if there is any mortal who knows more about love than thosegods of olympus he cited earlier it is he having been married fatheredchildren carried on affairs with men and associated with lesbians i amcertain there is little about love—or lovemaking—that oscar couldnt writea book about      i barely get into the cottage when there is a knock on the door      its the inns maid she seems a bit hurried your friend sent me to tellyou to come to the stable theres a problem with one of your ponies      oh no did he say whats wrong      no madam just for you to come quickly      i throw on a shawl and head for the stable which is only a hundred feetfrom the inn      we named the ponies adam and eve and i dearly love them boththey belong together theyre a team wells laughs at me for worryingabout what will happen to them if they were separated the most commonserious injury to a horse is to its legs and i hope that isnt the case it is agiven that a leg injury to a person can be healed but for a horse it is almostcertain death      i confess i love animals and unfortunately because i feel such a bondwith them i react emotionally to their injuries they are like children sohelpless      as im coming up to the stable i notice a black carriage parked off tothe side of the building its the most luxurious rig i have ever seen      to my surprise i find the stable doors shut and bolted i stop athought flashes that petrifies me—ive been set up      i didnt tell the others i was returning to the cottage or leave a note forwells that i went to the stable no one will know where i am      i spin around to get the heck out of here when i hear a familiar voicefancy meetin you here      a man steps out of darkness not reached by the oil lamp above thewide stable doors      burke—the ruffian from the spa      ugh barely escapes my mouth as a hand comes around from behindme and smothers my mouth as a sharp point is thrust against my neck      open your flap dolly and ill shove this all the way to your brain      ice pick      my heart stops horrible visions of archer and weekes flash beforeme      burke takes my arm and keeps the ice pick on me as the man behindreleases me now lets calmly walk to the carriage and get in      with the ice pick to my throat we make our way over to the carriagea few times my knees feel like they are going to collapse but i force themto move forward only because i know that if i fall i will be impaled with thepick      a gold crest of nobility is on the side of the carriage      i am shoved inside with the thug coming in behind me still holdingthe ice pick      the woman i had first seen getting out of the black coach at the spaentrance faces me a small oil lamp takes the edge off the darkness in thecarriage designed for the rich and noble      she is elegantly dressed in black the cloth being of fine lace a veilmost women wear for fashion alone is again hiding her features for reasonsonly she knows      what do you want from me my voice is controlled anger if the icepick wasnt next to me id slap her how dare she      the woman raises the veil      she is old and wrinkled at first glance but as i take in more of herfeatures i realize that she has aged prematurely because there is ayouthfulness that is almost completely hidden behind the mask of old age      she smiles at me      i want your blood my dear            part ivthe laboratory of dr lacroixbut first on earth as vampyre sentthy corpse shall from its tomb be rentthen ghastly haunt the native placeand suck the blood of all thy racethere from thy daughter sister wifeat midnight drain the stream of life  —from lord byrons the giaour quoted by john polidori in the vampyre   1819 written that haunted night during which mary shelleys frankenstein was also                                                                               born                                     60what exactly did you tell her      wellss question to the inn maid who delivered the message to nellieis asked in a grim angry tone the girl cringing like a rabbit frozen inplace as it stares at a predator appears ready to bolt      just what her friend asked me to tell her sir      how do you know hes her friend      the woman is on the verge of tears and oscar puts a restraining handon wellss arm      youve done nothing wrong oscar tells the girl in a soothing toneyou did exactly as you were told but my dear nellie has disappeared andwe need to find her      she probably went off with her friend      there is no doubt she left oscar says gently but the man wasnther friend hes a criminal and he has taken her      the maid gasps and covers her face      its all right it was not your fault but you want to help her dontyou      you can be sure of that      what did the man look like      i dont know he looked a little like my brother jeremy people sayjeremy is tough you know what i mean with his fists but he didnt dresslike jeremy his clothes are london fancy      how old is jeremy oscar continues      hes my older brother i think hes bout thirty      was anyone else with the man      no sir just him alone told me to go tell his friend one of the poniesis sick and she must come to help him so i did that i didnt do anythingwrong      no of course not my dear we are just trying to find out what yousaw oscar says in a sweet tone the village girl had no knowledge of themurderous machinations      was he wearing boots ones with pointed toes wells asks trying tocontrol his frustration and anger at this maid for being so stupid as far ashes concerned      boots with pointed toes ive never seen boots like that i didntnotice what he wears on his feet i dont pay attention to peoples feet      wells and oscar turn their attention to conan doyle who is hurryingtoward them      there was a carriage he tells them a little out of breath parkednear the stable an expensive rig with four horses the innkeeper andstableman both say it doesnt belong to anyone in the area and that theyvenever seen it before had some kind of emblem … a gold crest they thinkon it but they couldnt be sure in the dark and all      no one saw nellie wells asks his tone gripped with tension      no one the maid doyle gestures      oscar and wells turn to see the maid darting away      let her go she knows nothing of importance oscar says to wellsand then answers doyles question apparently a man about thirty toughlooking like her brother said to tell nellie a pony was sick      it was a clever ploy wells states bitterly nellie loves animals sherushed right into the trap without even thinking      boots      she didnt notice wells answers doyles question they must havetaken her north i dont think they would have gone south not in a bigcarriage the roads too rough im getting my buggy and going after them      wait a moment please doyle grabs his arm the innkeeper tellsme that its less than an hour to the main road to okehampton theyprobably made the road already theres no way our pony buggies canovertake a fourhorse rig especially on a good road      ill get a horse— wells stops as doyle shakes his head      ive asked there are no fullsized horses in the vicinity and noteven a local constable okehampton has the closest police station      no place to wire from here oscar asks      doyle shakes his head again okehampton is the closest when weget there well send out a wire to every police station in the region we canbe there in less than three hours but it will be the middle of the night andeverything will be shut down and locked tight      then we shall awaken the entire town oscar says well organizesearch parties territory that would take us days to cover can be done byvolunteers in okehampton in hours      we dont even know where to begin wells says his tone is asworried as his gloomy expression we really dont know if lacroixslaboratory is within a sixmile range of the castle thats an estimate basedon the artists endurance he could have visited the castle in a buggy for allwe know      doyle turns to wells the equipment for the type of experiments heconducts does it involve any large or heavy apparatus      no i would think not nothing that cant be easily lifted by a manwhy do you ask      from what youve said lacroix must have known for some time thathe could ultimately be traced to dartmoor you suspected the laboratory isin dartmoor from the shipments you learned about we believe the artistweekes knew where the laboratory was because of the bog he painted thatleads to the theory that the facility is in this region but begs the question asto whether it is still where it was when weekes painted the bog      youre wondering whether he could have broken down the laboratoryand transported it elsewhere oscar looks at doyle      my god yes wells throws his hands up it wouldnt be thatdifficult for the type of research lacroix does his entire laboratory couldbe boxed up and transported in one large wagon once he became awarethat we were searching for it and had some idea of the location he probablymoved it it could be anywhere      logically anywhere in this region doyle offers weekes was killedto prevent him from pointing the way to okehampton although he did sowith the lady howard story that and the other death implies that even ifthe laboratory was moved its still in dartmoor and most likely the northernpart      then my friends oscar says if the lab is so easy to move andhide it raises a most puzzling question      he didnt have to put the question into words all three men hadanalytical minds and extraordinarily fantastic imaginations not being aman of few words oscar spoke the question     if they can easily hide why would they have exposed themselves toso much danger and police attention by kidnapping nellie     wells takes a turn at further stating the obvious theyve hadopportunities to kill her and havent done so he stares at the two men hisfeatures a mask of dread     vampires     what oscar and doyle both exclaim at the same time     thats what archer kept toying nellie and me with he kept sayinglook for vampires     and… oscar asks     they want nellies blood says conan doyle                                     61the dark night reveals no clue where im going as the carriage rumblesalong the only sign of habitation i can see out the carriage window is theoccasional dim lamplight from a farmhouse     i sit facing the countess with burke beside me     the only other person on the coach is the driver whose name i heard ishare a chip off the same hardedged block as burke both of the men wearcowboy boots i havent gotten a good look at hare but i assume he is theman who killed isaac weekes     an expensive coach pulled by a team of four moves surprisingly quickdespite the narrowness and ruts on the road im certain its making bettertime than wells and i did with the small buggy despite the roughness of thetrack from the turns it makes i know the carriage is taking me north on aroute that will connect to a more traveled road that flows west from exeterto okehampton and beyond the same route we were taking to get tookehampton     the fact we are heading for okehampton offers i hope one smalladvantage to me—its the route wells and i were on and the natural one thathe and the others will follow to affect a rescue since we concluded that thelaboratory was there     i am frightened to death but wont satisfy them by showing fear     no word has been spoken except when burke sitting next to me startsto light a cigar and the woman in black says no he immediatelyextinguishes the match     the words she spoke to me when i was forced aboard are the cause ofa knot in my stomach and a lump in my throat from my conversations withwells about the nature of lacroixs research i am certain i know what shemeant     while i keep my features impassive my innards are convulsing and ifight to keep panic from gripping and paralyzing me i am completelyhelpless at the moment but if a chance to escape arises i need to be ready totake it screaming is futile there is no place to run or hide no one to shoutto for help     i am still stunned by their simple ploy to take me how utterly cluelessi was about the situation and so foolish to mindlessly walk away from theinn without even telling my companions     my eyes keep going back to the woman in black     burke calls her countess and never uses anything but the titlestrange but i dont think of her as having a name i wonder if she is awidow or if the clothes are a reflection of her dark spirit     an hour has passed and i am certain by now that my friends will havediscovered i am missing they are clever men brave and resourcefulfortunately dr doyle is also familiar with the area im sure theirimmediate plan will be to get to the police and organize a search for thelaboratory in the okehampton castle area that we have estimated itslocation to be     soon it becomes a much smoother road than the goat paths wells and iseemed to have always been traversing in the heart of the moors we nowproceed at a quicker pace i realize that we have reached the main road anda shock hits me—we turned right onto the road     from the map wells and i had pored over okehampton is a left turnwhen reaching the main road     a barely audible chuckle comes from the woman yes the laboratoryis no longer in okehampton     it doesnt matter where you are taking me my companions areextremely capable of finding me you will be caught you dont believe itbecause you are so desperately caught up with your desires you are notthinking clearly and you sir i tell burke we know about your gang andthe killing of the artist if you want to avoid the hangman youll do nomore crimes for this woman     burke grins you really have me scared is that whats gonnahappen he asks the countess in a mocking tone this womans gonnahave me meet the hangman     no that wont happen—not that you havent earned a trip to thegallows many times over she directs her next comment to me we aregoing to a manor owned by a duke and loaned to me no one would dareinvade its grounds and when we leave there will be no sign we were everthere      she has a continental accent italian i think but there is a british edgeto her english      do you believe in god i ask curious about how she deals with theevil inside her      my personal beliefs are drawn more from the east      really has it occurred to you that the punishment for the evil youhave committed in this life is to be reborn as a worm in a cesspool      she leans across the carriage and slaps me hard across my face      i freeze for a second and then start to move forward to swing at herwhen burke blocks me with his arm and an ice pick comes up and pricksme on my neck under my ear      settle down he says      if you cooperate and do what you are told you wont be harmed thewoman says      wont be harmed      does she really expect me to believe that murder has followed in thewake of this woman and lacroix and she assures me that no harm willcome to me if i play along but i keep my mouth shut because the more isay the more opportunities they will have to hurt me      it seems weve traveled for more than an hour before we turn off themain road and follow a side path to tall iron gates      the glow of a full moon breaks through the foggy haze enough toreveal the manor house that commands the top of a hill in the distance      the estate is almost castle looking truly fit for a grand noblemanbearing the title of duke      i dont see any lights in the house      from the distance the house appears dark and forbidding as we drawcloser it becomes evident that the house is also made of moors granite butthe stone has been finished      the carriage follows the curve of the road up to the main building andwe continue past it to a coach house two large mastiffs chase the carriagebarking      dont bother trying to run the countess warns me there are noneighbors and the dogs will treat you as game to kill    the door to the carriage storage house that is used for foot trafficopens and a young woman comes out                                      62hailey comes to me to give me a hug and i push her hands away     i am not surprised a bit the fact that she is still alive has beengnawing at me for some time but i just didnt want to face it instead iburied the revelation deep inside me     im sorry hailey says but everything will be all right i know thatfor sure they promised me you wont be harmed     i smile sadly at her my jaws are tight i dont have the urge to strike ather like i did with the countess before she slapped me instead i feel likehugging and crying with her—after i grab her and shake her and scream mylungs out about how she could be so stupid     please nellie—     i get right into her face people are dead and im going to be joiningthem do you think that sorry might be a little inadequate right now     no thats not going to happen you wont be hurt     how can you say that ive been kidnapped with an ice pick at mythroat by murderers who have left bodies in their wake     the mastiffs come sniffing up to me and i let the big male smell myhand     how could i have so misjudged her my editor at the paper had calledher a loose cannon and told me i better learn how to duck because younever know in which direction she will go off     she is ready to cry please come inside you must meet anthony     you make it sound like ive dropped in for a bit of tea did youhappen to notice that i have been kidnapped by thugs who kill people withice picks and a madwoman who wants my blood     get inside burke snaps     come please hailey begs me     she reaches for me and i brush away her hand with nowhere to run orhide i reluctantly follow her into the coach house     the main room large enough to park two large coaches has beenmade into a research laboratory a long table in the center has microscopestest tubes petri dishes bunsen burners surgical instruments—the tools ofthe trade by researchers in the biological sciences i suspect that drpasteurs laboratory in paris isnt much different except for one thing i seemany glass containers filled with a deep red liquid that im certain is blood      a chimpanzee is lying on its back tied down to a table with tubes toits throat      its sedated hailey says      the whole bunch of you should be sedated im sure the poor thingwould rather be dead than live through the horrible things youre doing toit      i wince when i see more chimps in cages i wish i could free them      anthony does research with chimpanzees because darwin says weare descended from apes      where is my cage      tears run down her face and her features twist as she quietly sobs      im not in a forgiving mood those cant be real tears for me thepeople your friends have killed or these poor creatures you know whythey call your kind of crying crocodile tears crocodiles shed tears whenthey are eating their victims im just another victim to be devoured      no nellie you have to understand anthony is taking his researchwhere no one else has ever gone before      has it occurred to you what hes doing is criminal      hes doing work that will go down in history      im sure he will right beside jack the ripper      nellie i thought if anyone would understand it would be you youhave such an imagination and are so daring youve seen with your owneyes what dr pasteur has accomplished with research      pasteur saves lives he doesnt take them away to give vain womenbeauty treatments      youre wrong on two counts      the pronouncement comes from behind me and i spin around to facethe man who spoke the words      anthony lacroix      he is slender with thin blond hair combed straight back narrowfeatures and emerald green eyes that focus on you with an intense fixedgaze that is almost an impolite stare       his fervent features convey the impression of determination but thereis also the hint of a bad temper and a handsome fragility to him the sort thatwould make him a mothers favorite and cause her to open her purse stringsfor him even when he misbehaves       exhaustion shows on his face as if he has been operating at a superspeed for a long period and is on the edge of collapse       dr pasteur has saved lives by developing rabies and anthraxvaccines he says but those discoveries came at the expense of otherswho were infected with the diseases by bad doses of the medicine beforethe process became a success the same is true about smallpox and othermaladies the cures served the common good at the expense of a few       i dont recall murder being part of the scientific method for beautytreatments or anything else       i havent murdered anyone       splitting hairs i interrupt him maybe you didnt do the deed butyou condoned it       you have no notion at all of the nature of my research you are wrongif you believe i am trying to make women look prettier the spa is just aplace to provide the money to finance serious research       you may fool hailey but i saw a poor woman in bath crying for herchild and a nice old gentleman in the moors—       your small mind will never comprehend my work he snaps takeher upstairs and keep an eye on her we dont want her wandering aroundthe dogs will attack strangers       as i follow hailey up the stairs to the second level she tells me theyare staying in the servants quarters so lacroix can be closer to his work iam only half listening because my concentration is on one thing only—escape       he works day and night barely taking time off to eat he sleeps verylittle a few hours here and there never a full night       hes a murderer and youre an accomplice to his crimes       she stops on the stairs and spins around to me stop it       her voice is quiet but with desperation       hes not any of those things she starts to say something else butlooks back down the stairs      hare the other ice pick thug is at the bottom of the steps looking upat us      we go up to the landing and move away from the stairway into asitting room with a hallway to the right were i assume bedrooms forservants are located closed french doors lead out onto a small balcony andi wander over to get a look through the windows theres enough moonlightfor me to identify a pasture behind the carriage house      anthony isnt a murderer she tells me in a low voice      why dont you ask the artist in the moors who got an ice pick in hisback or another man who got one in his brain      she shakes her head frantic and puts her hands over her earstheyre not things anthony would do      see no evil hear no evil tell that to the police when they come foryou and to the hangman when he puts the rope around your neck      she stares at me swaying ready to collapse and sits down on thecouch i take a seat on a chair facing her      she really doesnt understand      i find it incomprehensible      shes a grown woman yet this is not the first time she did somethingbizarre because of haileys own traumatic background i found reasons tojustify why she aided a woman in new york who killed her abusivehusband but i cant comprehend how she can close her eyes to theseatrocious crimes against innocent people      is she completely devoid of reason and common sense      hailey … tell me what you think is going on here i gesture towardthe stairway what is being done down there why have people beenkilled and please dont tell me they havent i witnessed the murder oftwo people and theres three more i know of beginning with ladywinsworth and a child i actually hadnt seen archer being killed butlooking at his still warmblooded body was close enough      for a moment we sit in silence      hailey finally meets my eye were prisoners anthony is doingresearch on rejuvenation on defeating the aging process of our bodies youcall it beauty treatments and its true that women like the countess want tostay beautiful longer or get back their youthful appearances but that is notthe true purpose of his research he does that work because wealthy womenare willing to finance his research if they think they will get what theywant     who do the thugs downstairs with cowboy boots and ice picks workfor     they work for dr radic and the countess she put up most of themoney that radic used to build the spa in bath she controls everything     how many of these hired killers are here     only the two youve seen     thats two too many so your dr lacroix just shuts his eyes to whatsgoing on around him and you shut yours too why     she avoids my eyes     because … because you love him     we sit in silence for a moment     hailey listen to me its not adding up you say you and he are beingheld prisoner those two brutes were away from here kidnapping me sowas the countess why didnt you just leave     we are not prisoners like that anthonys research cant continueunless the countess keeps financing it and keeps the police from botheringhim she has powerful friends he didnt hurt lady winsworth deliberatelywhen blood transfusions are done sometimes people die     sometimes people die     she said it as if she is speaking about nameless people in a textbooknot a woman and child of flesh and blood real people with loved onessaddened by their loss good lord—she is so mesmerized by lacroix soinfatuated that she simply takes whatever he says as the gospel no matterhow strange it may be     was she getting blood from a child a little girl     hailey nods yes but the woman had a bad reaction     so did the child i shake my head trying to get the pieces rattlinginside to fall into place what a … a horror story you simply fell for thisman and tolerate this insanity     its not just that her eyes are that of a wounded doe anthonyneeds my blood                                     63inspector mulcher the highestranking police officer in the okehamptondistrict is not happy about getting the local manager of the telegraph officeout of bed to open the wire station nor is he pleased about planning awidespread search for a foreign woman in the middle of the night wakingneighbors and sending them down the streets to wake others and have themgather into groups to spread out and hunt for the woman      a police officer for thirtytwo years most of his police duties hadcentered around stolen livestock and an occasional domestic dispute theonly serious case he had ever investigated had been that of a woman whosplit her husbands head with an ax and he had been a young officer whenthat occurred      like the telegraph office manager he had been awakened by bangingon his door and shouts from strangers outside then he listened with someastonishment about a woman being kidnapped—not any woman he wastold but a famous american newspaper reporter nellie bly and that thekidnappers drove the most expensive brand of carriage in the kingdom      the amazing situation doesnt end with the victim and the kidnappers      the men at his door it turns out include a wellknown writer and ahighsociety wit from london      he keeps his temper stowed because he has heard of the authorsstories about a detective named sherlock holmes and his wife has read inthe newspaper about the rather large and unusually attired individual fromlondon whom the inspectors wife says is a london society nob      however he cares less about the social butterfly than the author who isalso a respected medical man      the third man a teacher also appears respectable though not one heor his wife has heard of and none have been imbibing another point intheir favor though he himself could use a stiff shot right at the moment tosettle his own nerves      hes never handled a significant police investigation and has no idea asto what steps to take although it did occur to him that kidnappers wantransom money      told that the motives of the people who seized the young woman werenot monetary and were in fact not even known left him with no clue as tohow to proceed to get her back      the inspector made it clear to the men from out of town from themoment he agreed to take action that he was fully in charge but beingprudent he had listened carefully and took notes as the excited men tossedabout ideas about rescuing the young american woman      now as he awaits news from a volunteer search party he stands withthe doctor and the socialite and watches the young teacher herbert wellswho is pacing nervously as if he is struggling with a demon      wells finally approaches him and his companions      does anyone in the area have a black coach not an ordinary one butan expensive rig the finest a town coach with fourinhand      none that reside down here except in the summer a handful ofnobles and wealthy squires have good coaches one or two may be blackthough i dont recall for certain      there was a noble crest on the door wells says      you saw the carriage dr doyle is surprised to hear this      no i saw a similar one in bath      a similar one in bath howls the inspector what does that have todo with the price of tea in china      i think theres a connection both nellie and i saw the town coach inbath though she saw it from a different angle and watched a womanwearing widows black get out of it she also saw that the coatofarmscrest on the door had been covered when we arrived in exeter at the trainstation she saw a duplicate carriage also with a coat of arms but this timeit was uncovered      whose crest was it the inspector asks      she wasnt close enough to make it out      was it the same woman in bath and exeter asks dr doyle      we dont know who was picked up or dropped off for that matternot only was the coach an expensive one it had unique markings that tellsme it belongs to the same nobleman though i cant explain why the crestwould be covered in bath and not in exeter     it may be that the woman had her noble crest covered to hide heridentity as she patronized the spa conan doyle paces back and forth as hespeaks     or the coach is owned by a nobleman who doesnt want to make itobvious that the woman is using it oscar says if it doesnt belong to thewoman in black the man may not want to feed rumors about himself andthe woman because it would become drawing room talk in london     quite conan doyle stops pacing and rubs his chin but he couldntcare less if the situation generated talk out in exeter     im sure the coaches are duplicates wells says its not uncommonfor rich people to order the same custommade coaches for their city andcountry places     but you didnt see the one she was carried away in the inspectorsays so it may not be the same one     true but its worth checking out conan doyle says black coachesin bath exeter and in the moors three are too much of a coincidence andthere is an obvious connection to bath its where all this started     there cant be that many luxurious black town carriages in the areaoscar says we should be able to find out with some inquiries     lets wire the police in exeter wells says     the inspector started to object but an excited conan doyle cut him off     an excellent idea it would also show them that our esteemed policeinspector here is on top of the matter and is where credit should go whatdo you think inspector will you wire exeter and other police facilities inthe region specifically about black town coaches     i was just about to do that very thing when the subject was raised     the chief inspector in bath too wells interjects ask him about thecoach and the woman in black nellie spoke to him he might knowsomething about the wealthy women at the spa                                     64anthony is a hemophiliac hailey quietly says      the statement throws me for a loop i have to think about what ahemophiliac is he bleeds more than other people is that what youmean      yes he has to be very careful because he can bleed to death from asmall cut his blood doesnt clot like others and he can also bleed insidewithout even knowing it      i nod chewing on the situation now i know why archer joked aboutvampires it isnt just the countess anthony needs blood and yours worksfor him      yes you cant just go around taking blood from one person andgiving it to another no one knows why but sometimes a persons blood ispoisonous to another person23 people have died getting transfusions somedoctors have even killed people giving them animal blood anthonydeveloped a way to test a persons tolerance for anothers blood by givingjust a tiny bit of blood if they tolerate that he slowly increases the amountuntil the need is filled      is that what happened to lady winsworth was she a bleeder      no as part of his blood work hes developed a rejuvenating bloodelixir for use at the spa but he wasnt ready to give it to just anyone ladywinsworth insisted that he let her try it it—it didnt work anthony thinksshe took more than she was supposed to at one time      ah i see it seems he cant resist rich women can he      she pouts anthony is a genius a savior of mankind      a regular saint what about the countess she told me she wanted myblood is she another bleeder or another aging woman looking for thefountain of youth      hailey looks away refusing again to meet my eye      its her face isnt it she thinks his treatments can erase her agewith … with my blood     i get a lump in my throat there is a reason they call it lifes blood ireally dont think i have any to spare     im so sorry you were brought into this you werent surprised to seeme did the countess tell you i was here     the only thing the countess told me was that she needed my blood imore or less knew you were alive when i found out about your luggage inbath i just didnt want to face it i trusted you as if you were a sister myvoice breaks and i turn my head struggling not to cry     what about the luggage     the luggage had been directed to a train going toward the moorsinstead of back to london i assumed something had happened to you andlacroix was getting his hands on the luggage to search for evidence againsthim and get rid of it but you were supposed to have gone back to londonit would have been stupid of lacroix to send the luggage in the direction hewas fleeing and im sure hes not a stupid man     it also made no sense that you stayed over in bath and permitted thespa to pay for your room that was unprofessional it just wasnt addingup     she nods the luggage was my fault radic went into a rage when hefound out i didnt have my luggage sent to the london train anthonydidnt want me to go back to the hotel and pick up my things but i neededmy stuff so i sent a message to have it delivered to the southbound tracknot knowing they wanted to create a pretense it was sent to london     the young woman in the morgue in london—another blood donorwith a bad reaction to the procedure     no anthony bought the body from an undertaker she was aprostitute who died and would have ended up in a paupers grave he toldme he needed me to drop out of sight once i had established a connectionwith the spa he didnt want anyone—like you—looking for me and findinghim     i suspect that is a lie from lacroix but i let it pass there are morethan enough dead bodies to go around then i had another revelation iwas lured here from new york     no nellie—     dont lie to me you knew i would come if something happened toyou and that i would be suspicious of the body at the morgue because nomatter what i was told i would sense it wasnt you but the real clue wasthe diary wasnt it the diary was left behind so i would find it when iread it i would suspect you were killed and follow the leads but archerstole it from me it cost him his life      anthony never hurt him      for someone who treats everyone with kid gloves your anthonyleaves a lot of dead bodies in his wake      he is on the brink of history with a discovery that will change theworld someday—      im not sure i have any days left there is still a big question leftunanswered and i almost hate to ask it why was i lured here all the wayfrom new york what does your mad scientist and his change the worldinvention need me for      listen up      i nearly jump out of my shoes burke has come to the top of the stairswithout us noticing      he speaks to hailey the doctor will need you in a few minutes hesaid to bring her with you      he turns and heads back down the stairs i ask hailey time for hisblood      i guess so      and time for the countess to get her blood      nellie please you have to understand—      whats to understand im in the hands of murderers i rub my headthis is all too bizarre hailey i have a terrible headache do you havepowders      theyre in the bathroom ill get them      she goes down the hallway as soon as i see her disappear throughanother door i run to the balcony doors pull them open and slip out ontothe small balcony      the fenced pasture below that spreads out behind the carriage house isfor the carriage horses i am on the second floor but its not too far downdirectly below the balcony are the roofs of the horse stalls      i lift my skirt and get one leg over the railing then the other andcarefully get a footing between the rails trying to control my panicbecause ill probably break a leg i drop down it is about a tenfoot dropand i hit with both feet but fall backward tumbling onto my backsidesmacking the roof hard with my back knocking the wind from me      rolling over i get to my feet and scramble to the edge of the stall roofand drop again this time into dirt softer than the stall roofing only goingdown onto my backside      i rush for a gate on the side opposite the direction of the manor houseas i run the thought of getting on a carriage horse and riding barebackflashes through my mind but without reins i wouldnt be able to stay oneven if i managed to get on in the first place      the gate is not locked but has a rope looped to a post to hold it shut ipull the rope off the post swing open the gate and dash out running as fastas my adrenalinedriven feet will take me      there is nothing right or left except long fields of grass i head straightfor a copse of oak trees a hundred yards away      behind me i can hear shouting and then a sound that curdles my blood      the howl of the hounds                                    65hounds snapping at my heels      theyre not ripping at my flesh yet but i hear them and know they willsoon be on my back      what insanity has hailey dragged me into      is she so damaged from her childhood trauma of murder and violencethat she is immune to the violence happening around her      as i run through the thickets stumbling over bushes and rocks whiletree branches grab at my clothes i hear the hounds getting closer theirbarking more excited i know from my memories in rural pennsylvania thatwhen hunting dogs get excited chasing prey they become instinctuallysavage ripping and tearing with their fangs at creatures they mightnormally just bark at      my heart is pounding my breathing labored i cant outrun the dogs orhide from them and there is no one to hear my cries it strikes me that theremust be servants at the main house year round but at the same time i sawno light at the house when we arrived lacroix must have had them sentaway      on big estates like this there would be gardener and gamekeepercottages but there are no houses visible in the moonlight if they are outhere i have run the wrong way to find them      i reach the thickets half out of breath but keep my weakening legsmoving the copse is dense branches jab me thorns cut my face and grabat my clothes as i dash into them going around trees not sure exactlywhere i am headed except uphill in the hopes there is rescue on the otherside      i gain a crest of granite and stumble down a slope toward what appearsin the dark to be a small meadow      the dogs come up running behind me growling and snarling and iturn to face them as they bound right at me      heel      its not a command i know but a scream borne of pure panic anddesperation it is something from my childhood recalling how my fatheryelled at his bird dogs when he wanted them to calm down and be next tohim and not scattered about      i lash out at them with the word and the reaction is startling—both ofthem stop running for a moment they are confused theyre estate dogsused to people and running free not killer guard dogs      heel i repeat in a softer tone      they come up to me growling anxious and excited but still confusedand unsure of how to act suddenly the male whines and i kneel down so idont tower over him and carefully reach out and let him sniff my hand thefemale snarls and he turns on her snapping causing her to back off      com here baby i tell her      she hesitates but reluctantly comes up to me and sniffs my hand      i reach out to both of them and scratch them behind the ears      i hear crashing in the bushes and i get back up and bolt down the hillrunning full speed down the dogs gallop alongside me      bitch      i dont turn around to look i just keep running in pure panic i knowits burke with his cowboy boots and ice pick      i stumble and fall forward as i come onto the flat area my momentumcarrying me forward faster than my feet can keep up the ground is soft andmoist and i quickly get back up as i hear him closing in fast behind me      i dash with a burst of panic and suddenly a shock runs through myentire body as if id been hit by lightning—the ground is spongy      i slip on the wet surface and suddenly burke is at my back crashinginto me sending me sprawling i scream as i hit the soft flora and feelsuction against my whole body the dogs are bounding about excitedsnarling      the thug hovers over me an ice pick in his hand she wont let mekill you yet but im going to poke out both your eyes so you cant escapeagain      the big male mastiff gets in between us and leaps up at burkesnapping sending the man lurching back      get away from me you bastard i yell     he swings out at the dog with his ice pick smacking the dog not withthe sharp end but with the side of his fist holding the weapon     burke jerks backward and gasps as his right foot suddenly sinksbeneath the surface with a pop sound as he jerks his foot back up his otherfoot goes down halfway up to his knee each time sinking him deeper anddeeper in the muck     he screeches realizing what is happening to him as he franticallyjiggles his feet pulling them up and down in short bursts but in seconds themuck is up to his knees and he is unable to pull his feet up more than a fewinches     his features are twisted with terror     sweat has broken out on his face and his breathing comes in franticgasps     i scoot back up on my rear feeling the softness of the bog mosscovering keeping as much of my body spread out on the surface as i can asi watch the man working his legs with a frenzy but sinking deeper     dont fight it i yell i dont know why i bother hes a murderer whoseconds ago was going to blind me and take me back to be drained of myblood but the advice came out     the dogs are still excited and moving about and i call to them as i amsquirming away keeping my body flat i dont want them to get sucked inand i yell to them shoo go over there shoo shoo     when the man is up to his chest still clutching the ice pick he stares atme his mouth gapes open help he pleads     i cant im still in danger of sinking myself and theres nothing for meto grab and hand to him     stop struggling i shout try to lay sideways flat     its no use he doesnt understand and even if he did its too late tomaneuver into a flat position because threequarters of his body has beensucked in     there are no sticks nothing to throw him if i can get onto solidground and back up to the woods i might be able to find a branch to handhim     still moving slowly off the surface that is trembling from burkesfrantic struggles i see hare the other gang member running down the hilltoward us     he stops at the bottom of the slope where the ground becomes flat andstares down at his own feet he takes a quick step back as if he werejumping out of a fire     get a branch i yell     hurry burke now up to his shoulders shouts for the love ofgod     hare looks quickly around and then stares at his mate and shakes hishead—there are no long branches about burke is too far from him and toodeep into the mire to save him without risking his own life     so much for honor among thieves     i watch sick and paralyzed as burke goes under still screaming formercy and rescues i turn my head and close my eyes to the horror     turning over onto my knees as i feel the firmer ground beneath me icrawl until the trembling beneath stops and get to my feet     i take a few steps and a blow between my shoulder blades sends medropping to the ground the breath knocked out of me     im flat on my stomach and unable to breathe as hare grabs me by theshoulder and rolls me over an ice pick in his hand     leave her alone     hailey comes up behind him and jumps on him the force of her bodypushes him off me     dr lacroix is suddenly with us     stop he commands the man then gestures at me get her back tothe house we need her blood for the countess                                     66as i walk to the house i am beaten and defeated exhausted physically andmentally stone cold dead inside and out i cant focus my mind is racingwildly but my thoughts are not about escape theyre not even coherent ionly know one thing there are too many of them to fight and no one isaround to help me … there is no way out no chance to reason everything istoo insane      i know my friends are searching for me but the countess is right—whowould suspect a dukes manor house what local police officer would evenapproach the place without hat in hand and mumbling apologies      i can see from haileys troubled features that the sheer stupidity andnaïveté of her actions are finally coming home to roost once again i havethe urge to grab her and shake her and scream what were you thinkingbut i already know she wasnt thinking rationally      whatever spell dr lacroix casts on women had worked twofold onhailey fulfilling his need for blood because he is a bleeder gives her achance not only to be a martyr but in her naïve conception of the world itprovides a genuine medical basis to justify the madness of his rejuvenationwork      even though we have fallen behind a bit from the two men i dontdare try to escape again it will just give hare an opportunity to stick an icepick in my eye which im sure he would be more than happy to do insteadi use the distance to ask hailey a question she hadnt answered earlier      why was i lured all the way from america there has to be plenty ofblood over here for that crazy woman to use and they dont even know ifshes compatible with my blood      you are healthy have more energy than most people youreintelligent and you cut yourself once when we were together you suckedthe wound and told me that it was no bother you heal very fast      you just described attributes for most of the people my age it has tobe more than that     hailey looks straight ahead yes you are always so perceptive yourreal name is cochran your fathers heritage was that of the scottishlowlands countess lucrezia was born in italy but her mother was also acochran the daughter of a lowlands earl when i told anthony that yourmother was a cochran he said they had been tracing the countesss scottishancestors because he believes that the blood from a common ancestral poolhas more chance of being compatible than that of someone randomlyselected he believes you and the countess share a common ancestor     god i hope not that woman was spawned by satan couldnt hefind people in the lowlands     he has several times but to no avail as i was telling you he hasdeveloped a method to take tiny amounts of blood and inject it into a personso they only feel slightly ill rather than violently ill or dying if the blood isnot compatible he thinks over time by using tiny amounts he can build upan immunity in people to whatever is bad in some blood he started takingsamples to use but silly rumors started up about vampires and they beganinvestigating and the process had to stop they even seized his samples hewas nearly arrested     so when you told him that i would come over to take care of yourfuneral arrangements he decided i would be a perfect guinea pig but firstyou joined him in this crazy scheme     he tested my blood after asking me questions about my backgroundand found out it is compatible with his own he asked me to join him in hisresearch and not just because of my blood but because i immediatelyunderstood the high aims of his goals and what a benefit it would be tosociety if he succeeded but since he was having so much trouble with thepolice he decided it would be best if he disappeared so he could work inpeace and that i should disappear too be thought of as dead so therewouldnt be talk that always erupts about his blood work     that she would have to disappear be considered dead to keep downrumors didnt make sense to me     no hailey i dont believe it he didnt fake your death to avoidrumors how are rumors going to spread out here in the middle ofnowhere he did it because people have a tendency to die around him hedesperately needs your blood but he cant afford another policeinvestigation if you die     hes not—     stop telling me hes not a bad man look who he keeps companywith its his blood research thats left a trail of death hes a fanatic socaught up in his research in his drive to play god with peoples lives thathes lost control he lets radic and the countess do his dirty work because itkeeps him free to experiment i dont believe that girl i saw in the morguewas a prostitute who killed herself with his track record ill bet you shedied when he experimented with her blood     i grab her arm to get her to look at me he has been experimentingwith children hasnt he     i—i dont know     tell me the truth hailey     i told you before he wouldnt hurt a child there is some belief thatthe blood of children revitalizes older people     well i know for sure hes been experimenting with children nomatter how much you want to avoid admitting it ill tell you somethingelse i bet if i have the body in the morgue thats supposed to be youreexamined theyd find a mark on it from the blood he took no onebothered to look closely because they believe she was a suicide     please…     she sounds sick but she has to face the horror that she has gottenherself involved in and the terror she has dragged me into     she is my only hope and even at that i have no idea what she can doto save me even though she doesnt have an ice pick at her throat she isalso a prisoner she just doesnt know it     i get another horrible thought     the woman in the morgue was pregnant he stuck needles in her todraw out the blood from her unborn child     hailey stumbles weakkneed and i hold her up with a grip on herelbow im not going to let her avoid the horror with a swoon     hes like those priests back during the days of the inquisition i hissthe ones so obsessed with the demons in themselves they tortured womeninto making false confessions of being witches i lash out at hailey hesa zealot so driven by his mission he has become unbalanced mad thedream hes pursuing is a nightmare to the rest of the world     no please—please stop i love him      i dont have the heart to keep pounding on her it wouldnt do anygood anyway there is nothing she can do for me finding a compatibleblood supply from a willing supplier dr lacroix would do everything hecan to keep her even resorting to force if he needed      as we neared the carriage house my own knees get weak and i tellher i dont want to dieyou were picked up in a boat starving the name on the boat was the lady vain andthere were spots of blood on the gunwale       at the same time my eye caught my hand so thin that it looked like a dirty skinpurse full of loose bones and all the business of the boat came back to me       have some of this said he and gave me a dose of some scarlet stuff iced       it tasted like blood and made me feel stronger                                            —h g wells the island of dr moreau                                    67i am to take the place of the chimp as the poor creature is unstrapped andcarried to its cage at the back wall i look around desperately for somethingto use as a weapon the hair on the back of my head is grabbed and myhead jerked back the sharp point of an ice pick goes against the side of myneck      dont even think about escaping hares rough voice whispers in myear im not finished with you for killing my mate      he died because youre a coward      stop it the commands comes from the countess tie her down itstime for my treatment      hare forces me onto my back on the table a strap is put across mychest and tightened until i can hardly breathe      hailey is suddenly beside me she needs to breathe she loosens thebelt so i get my breath wiping sweat on my brow she leans down andwhispers forgive me ive been so stupid      hailey moves away as dr lacroix comes to my side he talks as heunbuttons the dress cuff on my right arm and moves the sleeve up      transfusions have been tried for centuries but with bad resultsbecause the practitioners didnt know how to do them they tried puttingthe blood of animals into humans to give people their traits make themstrong like a bear or a bull make them calmer with the blood of a lamb butit usually results in the death of the person      he selects a lancet a sharppointed knife used by surgeons to makesmall incisions      the first actually documented transfusion took place when popeinnocent viii was dying several hundred years ago when the sixtyyearold pope was on deaths bed the blood of three young boys was infusedinto him in an attempt to help him recover he died and so did the boys      i watch with a macabre fascination as if i am not involved as lacroixheats a small round glass container over an alcohol burner      i am going to draw blood from your vein what we call breathing avein he says too calmly the blood is taken by cupping i do it by cuttinga small hole in your vein and then put this warm glass cup over the woundthe heated air in the cup creates a suction that draws blood it is safer andcauses less infections and internal bleeding than sticking a needle into thevein      he feels my arm to locate a vein this will hurt very little      i hear his words but they are meaningless to me the only thing icomprehend is that he will take blood from me      he leans down to me with the lancet and i give an involuntary cry ashe slices into my arm deep enough to reach a vein removing the heatedglass cup from the burner he places it over the wound      i feel both the heat of the glass rim and the suction as it pulls bloodfrom my vein my body is shaking uncontrollably and i bite down on my lipto keep myself from whimpering or crying more from terror than the pain      he leaves me and hailey is suddenly there      she bandages my wound by wrapping a white cloth around my armand pulling it snug then she undoes the strap holding me down and helpsme sit up      i am shaking so badly i cant hold the glass of water she offers sheholds it for me and i guide it to my lips she sets down the glass after i havedrank my fill and says ill be back      sitting on the edge of the table i am weak and faint but watch withdark fascination as dr lacroix speaks to the countess while he prepares aninjection of my blood for her      the first injection i give you will be minute just a tiny drop if youfeel no effects from it i will slowly increase the dose over a period ofhours pausing between each injection to ensure that your body is notreacting negatively to the injection no one knows why an injection ofblood taken from one person can harm the person receiving it and the sameamount taken from another person can be of benefit but the technique ihave developed should ensure that you have no serious reaction if you feelill at all i will stop it immediately and we will know that she is not theproper donor for you      his last words about the possibility of not being the right donor promptanother hairraising question in me     what if i am not the proper donor does that mean i am disposable     my life hinges on the compatibility of my blood with hers     as the time ticks away i sit and watch the countess as she reclines ona couch with her eyes covered     hailey has disappeared somewhere     the countess has no reaction to the first injection and he tries anotherand then a third my eyes are getting lazy trying to close when i hear thecountess suddenly screech for a moment it sounded like a death rattle tome but she sits up with a wide grin     i feel rejuvenated she shouts     dr lacroix welcomes the news but the two briefly argue as thecountess demands a full dose     it may just be your excited desires he tells her we have to movecautiously     he gives her another injection but this time she is only down for a fewminutes before she is on her feet again     i tell you its working she shouts at him i want more she staresat me her eyes wild and crazy i want all of her blood now     mother of god                                     68its too dangerous we cant just give you all the blood dr lacroix sayswe have to follow the protocol ive established      we have to rush you fool dont you realize her friends will be heresoon in this sparsely populated area the carriage has to have stood outsomeone will have seen something      she gets up and faces lacroix and he fades back just enough to make itobvious to me that he is not only under her control but frightened of her      weve spent years trying to perfect your procedure and looking for amatch her voice is controlling and demanding i am not going to losethis one we can drain her blood put it in airtight containers and store themin the estates icehouse      she turns to hare after were finished with her take her to the bogshe can join your comrade      drain my blood dump me in the bog      im off the table with my feet on the run the moment the soles of myshoes hit the floor      i hear the countess shout stop her      hare comes at me and connects his shoulder against mine sending mestaggering hitting a lab table i go down as the table flies over sendingscientific apparatus flying everywhere flames burst up from an alcoholburner      he stands over me with his ice pick i told you i would put out youreyes      leave her alone      hailey has come down from upstairs and pauses at the bottom she hasa doublebarreled shotgun holding it with both hands the butt against herside just above her hip      i told you she was crazy hare yells to the countess as he chargeshailey      stop hailey screams      hare keeps charging and the shotgun goes off with a sound that isdeafening hare spins around and falls backward onto the floor      for a frozen moment everything in the room is still      ive gotten up onto my knees and stare wideeyed at the large blotch ofred spreading across hares chest as his arms and legs shake compulsivelyas if some energy source is trying to escape his dead body      i feel the heat of the fire caused by the broken alcohol burner—itsraging next to me      run i scream at hailey      the countess has pulled a dagger and is going toward her      hailey backs up her heel catching on the step behind her and she goesdown the shotgun going off the blast appears to me to have hit thecountess because she spins around and loses her footing but goes downonly for a second and then is back up      the burst from the gun actually hit lacroix—hes down on the flooron his back lying still      the countess still has the dagger once on her feet she sways for amoment then like a rabid dog that is mindless except for its rage she goesfor hailey because thats whos in her sights      i grab a microscope that is lying on the floor next to me and get up andrun as fast as i can      as the countess comes up to her hailey rises and pulls the trigger ofthe shotgun again but nothing happens—shes used both barrels      the countess raises the dagger and plunges down      hailey handdeflects the strike but the sharp blade catches the insideof her bare arm slicing down it      grasping the microscope by the narrow lens end i swing it as a clubthe heavy iron footing hitting the countess on the side of her shoulder itsenough to make her drop the dagger and send her sprawling      behind us there is an explosion as the fire below spreads to anotheralcohol lamp the escape path out the front is swallowed by roaring flamesand the room has become dense with smoke      hurry i tell hailey as i start up the stairs i dont realize she isntwith me until ive taken several steps i turn around and she has gone tolacroixs body she sits down next to him and puts his head in her lap shehas the countesss dagger in her hand      hailey      she looks up at me and shakes her head her face tells me she hasmade her choice she would rather join the man she loves in death than facelife without him      i turn my head as she raises the dagger with both hands to plunge itinto herself i dont look but start racing up the stairs      reaching the top of the stairway i stumble across the living space myeyes and lungs burning from the fumes i reach for the doors to the patioonly because i know where they are      pulling open the doors i am grabbed from behind by female hands thatclaw at my throat and start pulling me back into the smokechoked room      youre mine      crazy bitch      i bring my arms up and bend my knees to break her grip she leansdown with me and i rise suddenly and push backward as i force her back itwist loosening her grip on my throat and break free      i step back and ball my fist to strike her      with a screech that comes out of my mouth but sounds like it camefrom a wild beast i throw what my bareknuckle pal would call a powerpunch straight at her face my fist connecting with her nose feeling thenose squish and squash as my fist makes impact      a spray of her blood hits me—her blood      she falls backward and i screech with glee as i race out onto thebalcony i want to get the hell out of here      suddenly the countess is coming at me again i dont know how butthat insane rage of hers keeps her going she comes flying wildly out of thedoor behind me but her momentum keeps her going over me and over therailing she sweeps by me with just a quick gasp as she realizes at the lastmoment of life that she is soaring headfirst toward a hard surface      i hear the thump of her hitting the roof below and leap over the railingas i did before dropping down to the roof      the countess is there too lying with the quiet of the dead her headflopped almost beneath her twisted in a grotesque angle      my first thought as i drop to the ground is to get the pasture gate opento make sure the carriage horses wont be harmed by the fire consuming thebuilding     thats when i see my three friends come running wellss voiceshouting my name as i swing open the gate for the horses     where are you going oscar shouts as i turn and race back to theburning house     to open the chimp

        "    \"london 1890 i shiver as i leave a gloomy london day behind me and step into a dankmorgue near the banks of the river thames this small branch of hermajestys coroners office is on a wharf near london bridge in that areacalled the pool the busiest part of the biggest waterfront in the world     the breath of the dead in this examining room has a sharp edge to itsmelling like paint thinner poured over ice blocks of ice are scattered aboutthe room lowering the temperature to slow down decomposition of thebodies with the runoff from the ice and blood slipping through slats in thewood floor     after the first attack on my nose another smell is apparent hiddenunder the prickly acidic tang of cleaning fluid—death a bouquet ofdecomposing flesh blood and body fluids     in a curious way the chill air accented by the scent of blood and fleshremind me of a visit i made to a meatpacking plant in pittsburgh when iwent undercover to investigate the conditions comparing an animalslaughterhouse with an examining room for the dead is a gruesome thoughtusually im not this morbid but the unstirred cold air full of strange smellshas awakened the dark side of my imagination     my name is nellie bly im a crime reporter for the world mrpulitzers newspaper in new york city i came to london and this chamberof death not for a news story but to lay to rest a dear friend     the room had been washed down recently probably moments before istepped in because the slated wood floor is still wet the narrow openingson the floor permit whatever comes out of the bodies to flow into the riverand back to the sea the thought of human essence returning to the ocean isa comforting one since some say that life began in the sea but as i stand fora moment to let my eyes adjust to the gloom of the windowless room thesmell of the thames—poisoned by the noxious wastes of man andmachines—rises to become a dominant stench in the room      the river stinks worse than the dead inspector abberline sayssorry that was badly thought out wasnt it      the scotland yard inspector who i met the previous year when i wasin london following a lead on a murder case1 gives me a look of concernas he hands me a vinegarscented nosegay meant to stun my sense of smell      i put it in my lace hankie but dont put it up to my nose i am here for adear friend and i dont want my senses muted      butcherblock slabs are set out in two rows a dozen on each side likebeds in a hospital ward wood is a cheap but an unfortunate choice formorgue tables because it stains white sheets many stained with blood andother body fluids are tossed haphazardly over bodies not being worked on      inspector abberline had entered before me to prepare the room formy visit—covering the naked dead lest they offend my fragile feminineconstitution i could have told him that i had already seen things in my lifethat no woman—or man—should have seen      from the appearance of the bodies that are not covered most of themhad been pulled from the river already in an advanced state ofdecomposition like new york citys waterways the thames is not agentle environment for human flesh one wonders how the poor fishsurvive      im grateful that most of the bodies are sheeted hiding the cruelties ofman machine or that done by their own hand i have been in morgueswhere bodies are left uncovered lined up like dead fish ready to be gutted      a woman dressed in widows black from bonnet to shoes is sittingnext to a male body on the first slab in the room her head drifts down andthen jerks back up as she fights dozing off a bell tied to the mans wristtells me that shes his wife or other close relative there for the waitingthe procedure occurs when the morgue attendants are not entirely certainthat the man is dead rather than risk burying him alive the bell is placedon his wrist for twentyfour hours if it rings he will be transferred to ahospital rather than the cemetery      my heart goes out to the woman she is a lonely figure full of hopethat has little promise      two tables down from her an attendant wearing a white cloth apron isscrubbing a male body dipping his bloody rag into a bucket and bringing itback bloodred water flying off the rag as it is pulled out of the pailsplashing on the floor and draining through the slats into the river      against the back wall are wood shelves with knives scalpels sawsand other medical instruments and supplies a small cart next to it is piledhigh with dirty bloody rags and clothing      as a crime reporter i have been in morgues before so as my eyessweep this room i recognize that its not a fully functional coronersexamination room despite some of the tools of the trade on the shelvesrather than doctors with saws and knives cutting into bodies or testing vialsof blood for poisons in a hunt for a cause of death i see only dienersmorgue assistants whose duties are to handle and clean the bodies      inspector abberline catches my look at the dieners and reads mythought if theres a serious issue about the cause of death the body istaken to the central morgue for examination most of the poor souls in heregave up the ghost voluntarily or were hastened to their maker by a bluntinstrument in a dark alley so theres no reason for further investigation      kind man that he is he avoids using the word suicide but that is whyi am in this chilly purgatory that is a temporary repose for bodies fished outof the river before finding a permanent place six feet under      something about the dieners with their white cloth aprons stainedwith blood is familiar to me but my thoughts are too crowded with keepingmy feelings under control to put it together the cloth aprons are somethingof a puzzle because the morgue attendants ive seen in the past had wornrubber ones      the remains of hailey mcguire are at the end of the line inspectorabberline says      the remains of hailey mcguire      a few weeks ago i knew a lovely young woman with that name full oflife and spirit the spirit has escaped for what i hope is a better place andnow her name is simply the inscription on a morgue toe tag attached to abody that constitutes the remains she left behind      i can see at a glance that almost all of the bodies in the room are malewhich is to be expected for a morgue on the docks i imagine mostly sailorsfishermen and dockworkers along with an occasional prostitute arebrought here hailey was none of these but people driven to end their livesnot infrequently find their way to water      hailey suicide how sad that is how hard it is to believe      the inspector gives me another concerned look and gently takes myarm were almost there      i give him an im okay smile as we make our way down the path ofthe dead      a gruesome thought that comes to mind is unavoidable one day thegray corpse of nellie bly linked to the name by only a toe tag will be anempty carcass in a place like this i just hope my spirit will have moved onto what i sincerely pray is a better place and not hot as hell—if you knowwhat i mean      the inspector hadnt wanted me to view the body not even after it istransferred to a funeral home these cases where the body has been inwater are best laid to rest with a closed casket viewing hed said but ifeel that i would be cowardly if i avoided seeing my friend and holding herhand as i say goodbye she has no one else      we pass a man who i take from his mackintosh and high rubber bootsto be a fisherman as he bends over a male body perhaps that of a shipmatewhose last port of call was davy joness locker the fisherman is puttingcoins on the eyelids of his mate      paying toll to the ferryman inspector abberline says      i know the superstition a payment to charon the boatman whoferries the souls of the dead across the river styx in the underworld is howmy mother explained it to me when my father died i was six and an oldfriend of his bent over the coffin before it was lowered into the ground toplace coins on my fathers eyes      im sorry      i can only nod my head in thanks for i still miss my father dearly andthe memory of his interment hits me hard as i see the fisherman placing thecoins it had been a rainy gray day with a deepbone chill in the air notunlike the funeral atmosphere i find today in london seeing the cold stiffpallor on my fathers face scarred me making it difficult for me to dealwith death      the coarse brutal man my poor mother married in desperation to keepus children fed after my fathers untimely death had made the scar apermanent open wound when he forced me to watch a cow beingslaughtered when i was a young teenager im making you tough is whathe said but i knew he was being cruel and mean because he found pleasurein playing the bully     i try to put aside those bitter memories as we come to a covered bodyon the last slab in the line     a diener wearing a fouled white apron stands by on the other side ofthe table waiting for us hes overweight with large jowls that quiver as hepurses his lips he slaps a fly off his cheek and looks to the inspector forpermission to remove the sheet my knees start shaking and my heart jumps into my throat \",\n",
        "    \"just a few weeks ago i was in manhattan covering a story about the sextrafficking of young girls from the orient when mr cockerill the managingeditor of mr pulitzers newspaper called me into his office      you need to sit down was the first thing he told me thisproclamation coming in the tone that something was desperately wrongalarmed me my first thought was that something had happened to mymother who lives with me      hailey mcguire committed suicide      he had been right i needed to be sitting when i heard the news      hailey was not just a dear friend but a young woman who like mehad struggled hard to get a job in the male dominated world of newspaperreporting a product of an orphanage without even a high school diplomahailey had been destined for work as a household servant or worse theterrible life of a prostitute having fought tooth and nail to break intoreporting and having left high school myself before completion because ofa heart problem2 i empathized with haileys struggles      actually i was the person who first directed her toward working as areporter after watching her testify at a court trial i was covering two yearsago      the criminal case was against a man who owned a service that referredhousehold servants he was accused of raping a young girl who had appliedfor servant work hailey had also applied through the agency and testifiedin court that the man had indecently touched her and she had fought back toavoid being raped      as i watched her on the witness stand reading from a narration givingthe precise time date and details of the incident i realized her descriptionof what had happened sounded like the newspaper articles i write—evendown to the rocky grammar my first editor said i had      i spoke to her after court and began giving her small assignments tohelp me gather information and was delighted when she came back with notjust what i had asked her for but information that showed she had a nosefor the news      expending no less energy and determination than hercules had done inperforming his twelve labors i managed to get mr pulitzer to take haileyon as a cub reporter running errands in the newsroom and finally getting herown beat at the criminal courts building      both cockerill and pulitzer with their instinctively negative view ofwomen in the workplace had been hesitant first about hiring and thenpromoting hailey finding her too softhearted for crime reporting idisagreed and didnt want to see her pigeonholed into reporting aboutweddings and funerals the only jobs open for women in news reporting—and even then few were filled by women      she gets too emotionally involved with people shes reporting aboutcockerill complained      thats what makes her a good reporter i said knowing it was onlypartly true injustices needed to be reported with an impassioned appeal forthe victims but a reporter has to remain a neutral observer while gatheringthe story i admit that i dont have a talent for keeping my feelings to myselfat any stage of the process but i didnt see her getting worked upemotionally when dealing with wrongs      she knows how victims of crimes hurt because of her ownbackground i reminded cockerill      hailey had not been born an orphan she became parentless at the ageof five when her stepfather bludgeoned her mother to death in front of herhitting her mother over and over with a short club until the womans facewas a bloody pulp and hailey had passed out on the floor after begging andscreaming for him to stop      i rejected cockerills accusation that my experience with my ownstepfather against whom i had testified in court about the cruel treatment hegave to my mother and us children was affecting my judgment      she can do the job i said      i was right—and i was sadly mistaken      yes like me she had a nose for the news and was instinctively drawnto battle injustice but i was able to remain impartial while doing a storynever stepping over the boundaries and getting emotionally involved eventhough i might cry into my pillow at night for what i saw and reportedduring the day      unfortunately hailey stepped over the line when interviewing awoman on trial for stabbing her abusive husband as he was beating her thepolice commissioner approached mr pulitzer with suspicion that afterhailey had interviewed the woman a number of times in jail he believedshe aided the woman by retrieving the murder weapon a kitchen knifefrom where the woman had hidden it she dropped it in the east riverduring a ferry ride the commissioner said—but couldnt prove it      hailey denied the allegation but mr pulitzer wasnt 100 percentconvinced of her innocence because the battered womans situation was tooclose for comfort to haileys own trauma i wasnt convinced either      if hailey had crossed the line she would end up in prison for hernäïveté i didnt believe she would lie to me if i asked her right out so ididnt ask and refused to discuss the situation with her when she appearedready to take me into her confidence      to avoid very bad publicity if one of his reporters ended up in jail foraiding and abetting a murder mr pulitzer whose heart beats with exactlythe same rhythm as the circulations of his newspapers decided to take nochances he buried the problem by sending hailey off to london totemporarily fill the shoes of the papers london correspondent when theman returned to new york with a medical problem      the correspondents job was mostly to cable home stories reported bybritish papers rather than hoofing it to old bailey and parliament to findnews so there was little opportunity for her to get personally involved in astory there was also little chance that hailey would find her job waitingfor her when she returned to new york after the heat over the murder casehad cooled      after telling me that hailey had killed herself cockerill had gotten tohis feet and began pacing he does not have an easy job mr pulitzer is aruthless taskmaster even going to the extreme of employing two men to dothe same job to see which one would pass mr darwins test of survival ofthe fittest      he wants you to get over to london and make sure that your frienddidnt leave any dirty laundry behind      still stunned by haileys death i just stared at him he of course wasmr pulitzer and by calling hailey my friend meant that any dirtylaundry i couldnt clean up would be dumped at my door      i warned him not to send her to london he continued who knowswhat happened over there to cause her to kill herself she wasnt quitebalanced the job was too big for her to handle being raw in the businessand all this is your fault you know she was your protégé      all but his last words had to fight their way through the haze id falleninto when he told me hailey was dead your fault were hot burning wordsthat made me want to cry      adding to the emotional trauma of haileys death was the fact that iam still agitated by what i consider to be mr pulitzers cavalier treatment ofme after i sent the papers circulation figures soaring a few months ago as iraced around the world to beat the record of jules vernes character inaround the world in eighty days3 i would have quit on the spot had myconcern not been to protect haileys memory she was a wonderful personand i was not about to let another reporter trash her name or mine as heradvocate      i left his office fighting back tears walking through the newsroom thatsuddenly became quiet as i entered reporters looked up and then backdown to avoid making eye contact while a couple of them so jealous of mysuccess in their old boys club of reporting that they openly smirked atme but i didnt give them any satisfaction of witnessing a femalebreakdown instead i walked past each and every one of them with myhead held high and my features showing nothing but determination until imade it to the ladies powder room then i burst into tears      i cried for hailey but i was racked with guilt did i drive the pooryoung woman to kill herself because i kept pushing her to jump hurdles thatshe was incapable of leaping      i sat on a toilet twisting my handkerchief around my right index fingeruntil it was red and throbbing from pain mr cockerill didnt have to orderme to go to london if anything it was vital i went i had to make surehailey was properly laid to rest and not thrown in a paupers gravesandwiched between strangers      i also prayed to god that i would prove that they were wrong abouthaileys too gentle disposition and that my insistence on pushing her intothe line of fire as a reporter hadnt so shattered her fragile disposition thatshe came to believe killing herself was less painful than facing life      nellie inspector abberlines voice brought me back to this horriblereality      i gasp as the sheet comes off and i stare into the terrible face of deathwhat chance good lady hath bereft you thus\",\n",
        "    \"it isnt hailey at least not the vibrant happy intelligent young woman iknew instead it is a body remains corpse deceased the departed it isbloated corpulent with the bloodless pale complexion of a fishs belly      jesus—joseph—and mary i uncontrollably exclaim im sorry itell inspector abberline and the morgue assistant who has thrown the sheetback over the body it—it caught me by surprise      the inspector takes my arm come dear well talk outside      i shake my head and pull away from the compassionate mans gripno its my duty to her to see this through i cleared my throat how dowe know that—she—is hailey for certain      inspector abberline pulls a charm bracelet out of his pocket and handsit to me recognize this      yes      the bracelet has two dangling objects—a tag with her name scratchedon it and a statue of liberty trinket      i found it curious a young woman of her status as a reporter wouldwear something this uh inexpensive he says      cheap is a better word for it theyre sold by street vendors at thedock where the boat to the statue of liberty boards its tourist junk but ithad great meaning to her you see hailey was an orphan when she waseleven she was sent to work as a household servant she worked long hoursand no matter how it was figured what they charged her for board androom always exceeded the pittance they paid her      sounds like she was indentured      exactly like a slave it happens all the time because orphanages areovercrowded she finally broke loose and moved into a settlement house forimpoverished young women picking up work wherever she could to herthat trip to liberty island which she paid for with her earnings wasconfirmation of her success she took the trip after she got her firstreporting job i choke up and cant admit that i had gotten her the job      inspector abberline pretends to busy himself looking at the bracelet togive me a chance to compose myself      there was a ring too i point at the other side of the shrouded formon the other hand please let me have it      my request is to the assistant the ring with a fake emerald made ofglass is on her right hand it is the only other piece of jewelry i knew her towear i had bought it for her last birthday i want the ring to remember herby its not valuable that is said to assure the morgue worker that i wontbe taking something of value he could have poached off the body himself      he gives the inspector a look and abberline nods the assistant pullsback the sheet just enough to expose the hand its on the fingers arebloated      no i gasp as he takes his knife to cut off the finger no leave iton      before we leave snip the ring off with a cutter inspector abbelinetells the diener you can have the band repaired by a jeweler he says tome      no let it stay with her i feel queasy and weakkneed but regain myequilibrium i meet the dieners eye i will check to make sure its therewhen she is laid to rest      are you certain that its her ring inspector abberline asks      yes i bought it for her why      just an added point of confirmation that confirms identity we havethe bracelet ring and a suicide note the name on the bracelet led us to herrooming house where we found the note shed left out several days offood for her cat and asked in the note that her landlady find a good homefor the cat      what else did the note say      its in the file at my desk so this isnt verbatim but she said … i amso sorry life is no longer worth living hes left me and i have nothing tolive for i feel so lost alone there is no way i can go back to america thethought of prison … no i cant go back i have no place to go and no one tolive for whoever finds this note please make sure my cat is given a lovinghome she also left money for cat food on her dresser by the note      killing herself in despair over a man i dont know how to fit it in withmy memory of hailey she was emotional but i have a hard time coming togrips with her taking her own life for a romance gone sour      she has a birthmark i almost forgot about it      where      behind her right ear a red mark about the size of a shilling betweenher ear and hairline she always pulled her hair forward to cover the ear      i turn away as the sheet is removed and turn back around after i hearthe diener say dont see a mark      can you show me where you remember it      forcing myself i bend down closer and look its not there      inspector abberline strikes a match and uses it to take a look yourecertain it was there      absolutely she used to joke and call it the mark of cain      couldve been washed away by her time in the water the morgueassistant says      quite so inspector abberline agrees      i—ive never heard of that my thoughts are jumbled by the lack ofa mark birthmarks are imperfections in the skin not a stain that can bewashed away      quite true but her body has been bleached as well as it might be hadit been laying in a washtub the rivers so sour it could peel the hide off arhino      i dont know … i just dont understand it i stare down at the bloatedface trying to find hailey in it wait i bend down to get a closer look ather head what is this      a wound the diener says      how did she get it on her head i look to inspector abberline      she most likely hit a rock when she threw herself into the river      or the diener adds it couldve been caused by the impact ofhitting the water if she jumped from a bridge or a passing boat could haveknocked her      the inspector nods to the diener to cover the body and takes mefirmly by the arm back down the path of the dead      i dont understand it i repeat i dont see hailey killing herself oversome man who—      she was pregnant      what i stop and stare at him     nellie dear i didnt want to tell you and color your memory of thesweet girl she didnt tell you anything about it     only that she had met a man she had fallen in love with on myvoyage to england i had kept reading over and over the last letter ireceived from hailey she was all excited about a new beau and how muchthey were in love but she had not given a clue as to who he is     do you know who the father was i ask     he shrugs dont know and wont ever know most likely a marriedman not an uncommon situation he gives me a look or an uncommonchoice for the woman to make     he is right frightfully so that it shakes me to my roots there isnowhere for a pregnant young woman without some means of support to goexcept the foul conditions of a poorhouse     i knew hailey she would never

        "    \"a cool breeze off the waters of the broad river thames is welcome as icome up the steps from the mortuary and into fresh air when i arrivedearlier the air had that fouled saltwater smell of waterlogged docks fishingboats and coalburning steam ships even though the great port of london ismany miles from the north sea after experiencing a dank taste of a placeof the dead the salty air is a perfume to me      the hansom cab i had arrived in is waiting for me the driver chattingand smoking with the driver of a freight wagon who is adjusting his horsebindings i shake my head letting my cabbie know im not ready to leave iwant to thank inspector abberline for taking the time to accompany me tothe remains of hailey he stayed behind to fill out a form releasing the bodyto a mortuary he assured me would treat hailey with respect i will contactthem to make the arrangements      the thick gray clouds give the impression of a massive dark blankethanging over my head like a shroud—a perfect atmosphere to fit my mood      a sudden wind comes off the water gathering packing materials lyingoutside a warehouse sending the rubbish swirling around just like thethoughts in my head guilt frustration helplessness anger sadness      my thoughts are a jumble and i need to clear them      suicide …      i truly hate this feeling of frustration and guilt how do people copewith suicide      my mind still rebels at the thought that hailey was so desperate soalone that she took her own life i experienced a sense of guilt from themoment i had heard the news but now i am also angry at myself forpushing her when she wasnt ready to be a reporter infuriated too at thelover who stole her innocence and then cast her out      if he had only cast her out—and hadnt murdered her to keep her quieti know where the thought comes from its that old familiar voice in myhead that is always far too suspicious of the dark hearts of others i mustaccept the fact my friend killed herself but paranoia is almost on the list ofmy faults though ive found most of the paranoia ive experienced assimply being heightened awareness      the fact she was pregnant and suffered a blow to the head raised theshort hairs on my paranoia bedeviling me also is the primal instinct in mygut telling me that suicide just doesnt fit haileys excited energetic loveoflife personality      still i have to listen to the other voice in my head the one that isometimes try to ignore but which is calmer and more analytical than theone in my gut and it is saying that hailey was gullible and impressionableand impulsive—a young woman who would often leap first and thinkafterward      that she would get emotionally involved and make love out ofwedlock with the threat of pregnancy is in line with how i see her evenwith a married man i ask myself as impulsive and emotional as haileycan be yes even with a married man      shame on any man who impregnates a woman and leaves herdisgraced and a burden on our society—if they dont end up in a river or ahouse of prostitution      the more i think about it the more tempted i am to track down themarried scoundrel who destroyed her life and write an exposé on the abuseof impressionable young women by older married men      with my anger rising i mosey away from the morgue trying toseparate my thoughts from what i saw in there and what i would do to theman who caused her death i should return to new york rather than wreakvengeance on haileys seducer there is much to occupy ones attention onthe docks boxes of cargo are coming out of the holes of ships in greatnetted bundles and set down on the dock where swarms of dockworkerspack them away onto wagons and into warehouses      down the wharf is a forest of tall masts and smokestacks black fromthe coal burned in their steam engines i see bales of tobacco from virginiacoming off a yankee clipper ship beef from argentina being unloaded froma freighter whose name should be bucket of rust blocks of ice from anorwegian ship moving down a long slide disappearing into an icehouse      the slide is several stories high leading out to a wharf where the iceblocks are coming out the hole of the ship as the cargo net with a singlelarge block sits down on the slide a man on each side uses hooks on longpoles to pull the block free of the thick rope netting and send it skiddingdown the ramp      convenient—an icehouse next to the mortuary      on my way back i realize that on the other side of the mortuary is ameatpacking plant where according to the sign in front argentine beef isprocessed i find it distasteful that the mortuary is so close to aslaughterhouse      putting a morgue between a meatpacking house and an icehouse on abusy dock offends my sense of order in the world and respect for the deadthe chinese would say the morgues position is not an auspicious settingfor a place of the dead that its not feng shui correct because it isnt inharmony with the hustle and bustle of its surroundings      the workers on the docks also strike me as a rather depressing lot notunlike how they are on the docks in new york there is a horribleexploitation of cheap labor for handling cargo with immigrants fromireland and other countries brought in to keep a constant force ofbackbreaking labor to add insult to injury they are housed in terribleconditions and work for long hours for starvation wages      seeing how truly ragged some of the dockworkers are and havingpassed en route to the docks poor neighborhoods with shoeless childrenlooking dirty and malnourished adds to my sense of how unjust the worldis in distributing wealth      some of the workers wear the tattered uniforms of workhouses thosepoorhouses where paupers are taken in and sent out to work for their boardand stay in dormitories where husbands wives and even their children arehoused in separate buildings the atmosphere is grim and intimidating withworkhouse inmates treated not unlike prisoners—men and women onadmission are stripped searched washed and have their hair cut work istedious and laborious living conditions disgusting reminding me of thesmall boy in charles dickenss novel oliver twist who lived in aworkhouse—poor miserable and always hungry      thinking about the haves and have nots and my own miserable yearsas a factory girl but fortunate as a woman to even have gotten a job where iwas paid far less than the men doing the same tasks i am lost in a brownstudy when i hear a shrill cry and look up to a raven on a lamppost      wonderful i tell him how appropriate did you come by to tauntme with nevermore      it appears he did inspector abberline says behind me a victoriacarriage bearing a door insignia of the metropolitan police servicecommonly called scotland yard has arrived as the inspector approachesme he looks up from reading a missive apparently delivered by the policeuniformed driver      and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shallbe lifted nevermore he continues my favorite poem he waves one ofthe messages hes holding my commissioner needs to communicate withthe new york city police department regarding miss mcguires passingwe received a query concerning whether she had mentioned anything abouther actions in the new york matter in her suicide note she hadnt      has her uh letter been examined by a handwriting expert icouldnt bring myself to say suicide note      i examined it ive had a bit of experience looking over such thingsby comparing it to her handwriting its quite easy to see that it was done byher own hand she wrote with something of an excited flourish that wouldnot be easy to duplicate had the note been very short say just a sentence iwould have had an expert examine it but it would be very difficult andtime consuming for even a clever forger to get close to a personshandwriting style when dealing with that much writing      i know hes right hes a good policeman who wouldnt be fooled by aforgery but before i return to new york ill sweet talk him into letting mesee the note anyway still i need to ask him about fingerprinting      i just wish you could check for fingerprints      really … so you know about dr henry fauldss awkward conceptfor identifying criminals      yes      im impressed      i hold my chin an inch higher i revel in it when i surprise peopleespecially men with knowledge they dont think a woman would have      then you know the method of identification was dismissed by ourmetropolitan police five years ago      yes and i think its a shame its quite a clever idea taking a personsfingerprints with printing ink and using them for identification do youknow how dr faulds discovered this      no do tell      while accompanying a friend to an archaeological dig he noticed insome ancient clay fragments that the delicate impressions left by workerscould be detected with the human eye he decided to examine his ownfingertips and then compared them to those of his friends each pattern ofridges was uniquely different      interesting abberline says however when he presented his theoryto the commissioner his evidence didnt show that prints are always uniqueto a person or that they can be practically classified and thats just naming afew holes in his notion he eyes me gravely you must accept that yourfriend killed herself      its doesnt even look like her      nellie she was in the water for at least a week i hate to bring this upbut you saw her face its awful what water does to a body and then youhave the fish and…      stop please i understand      im sorry that was insensitive of me      no youre correct      i look down at the ground i wish i could erase that moment when isaw haileys bloated face      he takes my arm and leads me toward the carriages my job as apoliceman would often be simpler if we were able to identify criminals andtheir victims with fingerprints      he has changed the subject deliberately and i welcome it i ask himdid you know that while dr faulds was living in japan his hospital wasbroken into and the police arrested a staff member      he shakes his head i know very little about the mans background      dr faulds thought the man was innocent and he compared thefingerprints left behind at the crime scene to the man they arrested and theywere completely different he was released      very good      it puzzles me that police agencies are still dismissing hisfingerprinting method      because we would have to have everyone in the worlds fingerprintsto make his method useable and that is impracticable and impossible hepauses and gives me another look of concern dont think of the situationas the loss of a friend she is gone and that is her choice and she is nolonger suffering the mental maladies that caused her sorrow shes at peacenow     i give inspector abberline a peck on the cheek youre right     he turns beet red and clears his throat with a guttural rumble nownellie dear please let me drop you off at your hotel we have thecommissioners own fancy carriage he indicates the victoria a fourwheeled carriage with a calash top a seat for two passengers and a perch infront for the bobby driver     thanks but i need to drop by haileys old office on fleet street tosee what needs tending to     ill drop you off and on the way you can look at haileys suicidenote     i thought it was at your office     i knew you would want to see it so i requested it be brought here     i do want to see it but i know in my heart it will throw out thepossibility that haileys death was not by her own hand i dont know if imready for that     shall we go     of course     before we pull away a man comes out of the slaughterhouse next tothe morgue and goes inside he has a bloody apron on and a saw in hishand     now i remember what the morgue attendants and their apronsreminded me of—the pittsburgh meatpacking house i had done a story on     change of shift i ask the inspector\",\n",
        "    \"my hands are shaking as i hold haileys suicide note inspector abberline isgracious enough to turn his head and look out the window      if anyone can recognize haileys handwriting its me ive seen enoughof it i believe that inspector abberline has alternative motives for gettingthe suicide note to me he also wants to make sure its haileys because ofmy reluctance like he said to me at the morgue just an added point ofconfirmation that confirms her identity…      i take a deep breath and look down oh no      its not haileys handwriting      no … its hers      he nods his head and looks back out the window      tears roll down my cheek as i read her letter i am so sorry for what iam about to do but my life is no longer worth living hes left me and ihave nothing to live for i feel so lost alone i dont know what to do thereis no way i can go back to america i cant bear the thought of prison no icant and i wont go back i have no place to go and no one to live for thereis only one thing i can do whoever finds this note please make sure my catis given a loving home hailey mcguire\",\n",

overcast acting as a ceiling to trap the cold wet air      he would not have noticed the chill in the air if he had been walkinginstead of standing around waiting and watching he can feel middle agecreeping up on him with arthritic pain starting at the bottom of his oftenaching feet now that he went everywhere by shanks mare no longer able toafford cabs thanks to his dear exwife who not only put him in thissituation but once the money stopped coming in she upped and left somegratitude      for years he lavished her with expensive clothing even those sillyfancy hats she wore like she was going to a garden party or something abig apartment dinners out in better restaurants than either of them had everbeen in before even going to plays like they were real gentry … then whenhes ratted out by his fellow policemen at the metropolitan police servicefor having his hand out too often she leaves      women … trouble thats what they are nothing but trouble      a street vendor is selling roasted chestnuts on the corner thechestnuts are roasting on a rack over a bed of hot coals in a halfmetalbarrow set atop a rollaway cart      the warm smell of the chestnuts breezes over to archer and he steps tothe vendor and holds out his hand with a piece of newspaper on it      the peddler gives a look at archers worn suit that needs sponging offand a hot iron at his soiled collar the

gathered along parkrow which is nicknamed newspaper row mr pulitzer and otherpublishers claim they put their papers there to be close to city hall but italso proves convenient for their reporters to spy on what the other papersare drumming up as with thieves there is no honor among reporters whenit comes to gathering news      even before i enter i know that behind the goodnatured bonhomienewspeople maintain publicly toward each other the true atmosphere of theplace will be cutthroat and secretive—whoever has a door locks it whenthey leave those only with a desk lock that too      the international news building houses correspondents from justabout everywhere that can be reached by the worlds undersea cables andoverland telegraph networks it even has its own cable office hummingwith messages sent off across the channel to paris berlin and rome tonew york on the other side of the atlantic and as far away as bombayhong kong and tokyo      it is truly a miracle of modern science that a reporter can send a storythat will travel several thousand miles under the sea by cable and then racemore thousands of miles on telegraph lines strung on poles across thecontinent to a newspaper in san francisco      sadly my presence at this building is not to send exciting reports ofwars and the rise and fall of empires but to dispose of any confidentialinformation on the news stories hailey might have left behind      the worlds regular correspondent will be back in a few days to keepthe news moving in the meantime mr pulitzer has arranged for acorrespondent from another of his newspapers the st louis postdispatchto also cover for the world      i hesitate hating to go in and rummage through haileys office i feellike a child whos been dropped off at school and doesnt want to enter alittle rain has begun to fall more of a mist than drops i wish it would pourso no one would know ive been crying       first i had to see haileys body and say goodbye to her then i readher suicide note and now i have to leaf through her work sometimes i hatelife       lets get this over with i mumble to myself as i reluctantly enter thebuilding       the newsroom before me is a familiar one not unlike the large baywhere reporters hug desks at the world—there is also the same cloud ofpipe and cigar smoke hovering and the sharp reek of tobacco smoke alongwith spittoons that need a good cleaning like most males of the speciesreporters—almost all of whom are men—believe they have a godgivenright to foul the air and spit disgusting juices at brass spittoons missingoften       a few cubicles along the wall offer some privacy and for the biggestnewspapers a category in which the world falls a stairway to the rightleads up to a balcony lined with doors to small offices i already know thathaileys office will be on the second floor       another common feature of the newsroom is a railing keeping peopleout and a person i call the gatekeeper posted next to the swinging gate tobar entry to all but the privileged       to get my first reporting job i had to make a mad dash past thenewsrooms guardian and through the worlds gate rushing into the officewhere i confronted mr pulitzer and mr cockerill with my plan to prove icould be a reporter by spending ten days in the madhouse for women onblackwells island       i will never forget that day in new york       i was penniless and desperate for work for four months since arrivingfrom pittsburgh pennsylvania i went to every newspaper on park row andwas rejected by them all and to make matters worse the night beforeseeing mr pulitzer my purse was stolen in central park while walkinghome leaving me without a cent that morning i not only borrowed a coatfrom my landlady but cab fare       determined to get an audience with mr pulitzer who had just returnedto new york from abroad filled with pride and persistence i hurriedthrough the newsroom i was not about to go back home defeated instead iplowed through like a steadfast ship its bow breaking water keeping mychin high and carefully lifting my skirt off the floor at least an inch to keepthe bottom from being fouled by tobacco juice that didnt reach thespittoons      my heart had been pounding and i was thrilled to have stepped into arealm where stories of life and death the stock market running amuck fameand disgrace came to life as reporters yelled back and forth at their editorsand a boy ran up and down the aisle grabbing copies from the reporters sothey could rush them to the copy editors      nothing has changed      now over three years later and having earned my salt with storieswritten down the street and around the world i still must face the stares ofseveral dozen men as i a woman dare to invade their territory      once again i put my chin up an extra inch but i cant help wonderhow hailey took the animosity and joking here in london i had alreadybroken in the newsmen in new york to a feminine presence so she didntface as much prejudice as she would have had to experience here      their stares and jabs would probably make someone as sensitive ashailey feel like she was walking onto the battlefield with bullets flying allaround her—a reflection that hits me again with my editors assertion thatshe hadnt been ready for a newspaper reporting job especially in londonthe hub of the newspaper world for all of europe      having to walk past these men every day without having provenherself capable of doing the job as i did with a sensational story wouldchip away at any persons soul no matter how strong they are and haileywas innocent in a beautiful soft way      may i help you madam a young man sitting behind the desk asks      yes im from the world in new york im going to our office here      you must be nellie bly      yes i am how did you—      recognize you from a newspaper clipping hailey—miss mcguirehad she spoke of you often im very sorry about—about what happenedthe young man stammers and blushes then gets up to hold open the gatefor me its a pleasure meeting you      thank you      if i can assist you in any way please let me know      a thought hangs with me as i go up the stairs hailey was a bright andattractive young woman and pregnant knowing hailey the young mandoesnt appear to be a candidate for her lover … but he might have gottenclose to her or even simply went out of his way to observe her i must stopand chat some more with him on my way out because he might be a wealthof information      with a key i brought from new york i unlock the door and enter      the room is a cubbyhole big enough for a rolltop desk against thewall to my right three wooden filing cabinets against the wall to the leftand a dirty window allowing a bit of dull gray light in between      beside the office door is a metal umbrella stand that has one largeblack umbrella in it above it is an empty wooden coatrack with a mans hatand a rain slicker      a chair on rollers is in front of the desk a bookcase and stacks andstacks of faded newspapers and newspaper clippings occupy every spacesomething else isnt taking up even the filing cabinets are piled high withnewspapers cobwebs make up the rest of the furnishings i just pray nospider rears his ugly head while im here i hate spiders      on top of the desk is a soft blue vase filled with pink roses haileysway to add cheer and femininity to this cluttered messy male office that isladen with the heavy smell of tobacco smoke imbedded in the wood      the roses are wilted i wish i had new ones to replace them i hatelooking at the dead roses—they speak of haileys death but they werehaileys and i am not prepared to trash them      i roll up the top of the desk shoved into the back right corner is a piperack holding four pipes next to it is a closed roundmetal tin that containstobacco the desk has coffee mug marks cigarette burns and ink stains allthe signature of the correspondent who regularly occupies the office      the desktop is cleared of most paperwork which surprises me becausetheres only a small space to lay items and hailey wasnt better than anyother newspaper person myself included in keeping manageable the notespictures and other items we gather for stories      either hailey wasnt working on any stories for sometime leading upto her death or she came to the office and cleaned up her desk before killingherself      she was an orderly person and it isnt beyond the realm ofreasonableness to conclude that she would straighten up her desk beforeending her life ive heard of people who washed their laundry beforekilling themselves      going through the desk drawers i find her hot news folder—a slimred leather envelope purse hailey had admired the one i have that i keepmy current work in as a surprise going away gift i gave her one      theres very little in it some notes about a society wedding a minorincident at sea between a british freighter and german warship the failureof a mediumsize london bank not the sort of news interesting toamericans that she was expected to dig up i recognized the articles asfillers that reporters on deadlines keep to fill in on those days when all thegood stories are hiding from you      she must have been so depressed she wasnt working on anything ofimportance in the days before her death      as i pick up a pencil to tap the eraser against my teeth an old habit ofmine i notice the eraser is blackened its been burnt      why would an eraser head be burnt      i look under the desk for a wastepaper basket voilà someone hadburned paper in the metal basket and stirred the ashes with the pencil      another why pops into my head why would hailey do thisreporting isnt that competitive what was so important to hailey that shenot only had to burn it but destroy it completely      or … did the man who ruined haileys life pay a visit to the office todestroy evidence of their relationship or her murder      here i go again am i barking up the wrong tree or have i discoveredsomething my problem is i dont want to face what i have been told iwant to find another truth      its time to speak to the gatekeeper\",\n",
        "    \"my instinct about the young man at the gate is that he is or was infatuatedwith hailey the pale thin young man with goldrimmed glasses strikes meas rather shy and perhaps even a little timid hailey had a more outgoingpersonality i cant see them as a match     exuberant excited by life and even rather adventurous hailey wasmore likely to fall into a swoon over a knight in shining armor than a mildmannered clerk but that doesnt mean they hadnt become friends or thathe didnt quietly observe hailey and know more about her than she evensuspected     did you find everything satisfactory he asks as i come out the gateand he rises to speak to me     somewhat mr…     james anderson please call me james     james do you know what trolley i can take to haileysboardinghouse from here with the rain if its much the same as in newyork there is little possibility of me catching a taxi i didnt give him theaddress because i am curious as to whether he knows where she lived     youre so right he chuckles and his face brightens up hailey and iused to laugh about how the cabs mysteriously disappeared off the streetsthe minute it just starts to sprinkle     you shared taxis     no neither of us could afford getting to and from in a hansom werode the same trolley number eightyseven her boardinghouse is just acouple of blocks from mine and the trolley stopped in between go to yourleft when you leave the building the trolley stop is three blocks up thestreet i see you are already outfitted with an umbrella a must in london     i hold up the black umbrella that was in the basket i requisitioned theone from our office james i need to know the stories hailey was workingon but i found very little in her office did she by chance mention anythingto you     no she wouldnt have spoken openly not with them being able tohear a jerk of his head tells me that them are the reporters in thenewsroom     she never mentioned anything at all     no im sorry     do you know who she might have been dating     he shook his head no idea i suspected she was seeing someonebecause she was so happy and excited     she spoke about the person     no not really it wasnt anything she said but how she acted andthere were the flowers     flowers she received flowers from a man     yes i dont know who sent them but i can tell you the man waswealthy     how do you know this     the flowers were exotic not your normal roses or daises     any chance you remember the name of the florist     that wont do you any good     excuse me why would you say that     instead of responding he instantly blushes and looks down at hisshoes     i gently touch his arm you were fond of hailey werent you     ya—yes he stammers     you wanted to make sure no one would take advantage of her so youasked the deliveryman who had sent the flowers     he nods yes but he didnt know a messenger always came withinstructions and payment     i bit my lip as i think about that it sounds very much like the actionsof a married man     miss bly did—did hailey ever mention me in her letters to you     yes she did i lie she was very fond of you     i was very fond of her too     i appreciate your help james if you remember anything pleasecontact me i will be at the langham hotel for the next few days     i turn to leave and stop as he says i dont believe it     believe what     that she killed herself     i take a sharp intake of breath trying not to expose my feelings whydont you believe it people kill themselves every day     arent people supposed to get depressed over a period of time slowlygetting worse and then finally ending it     i almost blurt out not if theyre pregnant but hold my tonguebecause i dont want to damage his memory of hailey instead i ask whatdo you mean     she wasnt depressed she was excited … even secretive     about what     dont know but she acted like any of these reporters act when theythink they have a big scoop they go around like theyre holding theirbreath theyre dying to tell someone but dont dare even give a hint     when did you last see hailey     two days before the police say she killed herself     two days were there other times when she didnt come to the officefor days at a time     not that i recall     and she didnt appear depressed     no im telling you she was secretive     as if she was onto a big story     yes id swear by it it was like she wanted to blurt something out butcouldnt he gave me a long hard look what do you think miss blywhy did she do it why did she throw herself into the river and—     everyone is different is all i can manage before i flee out the door                                    10never have my feet moved so fast to remove myself from a building and ikeep walking fast once i hit the street—very fast im not hurryingsomewhere but fleeing the suspicions of the lovestricken james      holy mackerel and i thought my paranoia runs rampant      i hadnt seen hailey during the days leading up to her death but jameshad and his impression of haileys mood—that clamming up by a reporteron a hot lead but dying to share—is exactly how i act and exactly how iwould expect hailey to have conducted herself\\t      face it i tell myself you just dont think hailey killed herself andjames inflamed your suspicions      what if haileys excitement wasnt about a scoop what if herexcitement was about the fact that she had found out she was pregnantand the man she believed loved her lied and told her he would marry herand killed her instead      nonsense but i dont know my paranoia gone wild maybe butjames had added not just his own impressions and feelings about haileybut a couple of curious facts hailey had not been around the office for twodays before she killed herself and the last time he saw her she had been inan elated mood      i chew on the information because it is so inconsistent with the way ilike james imagine the character of a suicidal person to be while it is agiven that her mood could have changed radically over a period of fortyeight hours the state of her office adds another puzzling dimension theoffice had been cleaned out that is the only way i can characterize it in myown thoughts cleaned out as if someone was not planning to return to it      while some people might be tidy about their possessions even whentheir head is full of killing themselves james told me that hailey had beenin a very high mood the last time he saw her two days before she died      if that were the case then hailey would have cleaned out the office ata time when she appeared to a coworker as having a pleasant—even elated—disposition      i shake my head the contradictions are rattling my brain if it isntlikely she would have cleaned out the office when she was in a good moodthen someone else came afterward and did it my prime candidate for themysterious someone would be the lover fearing scandal      as far as getting access to the building without james noting him thatcould have been accomplished any number of ways in fact i should haveasked him if any strangers had been inside the building or if anyone elsehad obtained access to haileys office besides myself      the brown study im in about hailey almost makes me miss the trolleyjames told me to take its crowded and im pushed into a woman next tome as the rail car sets off with a jerk she pushes back and then nudges me      look at that foolish man      a man with a bowler hat is running frantically to catch the trolley hegrabs a handrail at the rear corner of the car and nearly slips under as heloses his footing but hangs on and pulls himself up to get footing on thestep      hes going to get himself killed one day i saw it once with my owneyes a man tried to do the same thing running after the trolley andjumping on while its moving only he wasnt as lucky raining like todaythe poles were slippery he lost hold and he went under it was awful hewas crushed to death by the wheels she shakes her head mark mywords one day hell end up with the same fate      shes right he had been foolish i just hope that whatever his hurry isits worth risking his life for\",\n",

aparlor is off to the right and the dining room to the far left its much thesame as the boardinghouses id lived in before i could afford an apartmentall were a little drab and lacking in the warmth a personal touch brings asimple vase of flowers and brighter furnishings would give the place a morecheerful and homey look      as we go up the stairs i ask the maid did you and hailey chatmuch      were not allowed to mingle with the residents she gives me a lookyour sister was a very nice person she always said hello to me and wouldask me how my day was she didnt treat me as a servant      yes thats hailey      i will need to stay with you she says as she fumbles with a skeletonkey as she opens haileys door mrs franklin has very strict rules      please … i need a few moments alone i hate putting her in a spotbut i cant have her watching as i make a thorough search of the room tellmrs franklin that i insisted ill leave the door open      i suppose its all right you being her sister and all ill be just downthe hallway cleaning      haileys room is small she has a window that looks out onto a gardenarea that has suffered the blistering of winterkill but i can see how it mustbe pretty in the spring and summer months hailey was lucky to have awindow it makes the room feel more open      she would have been able to look out when she was relaxing on herbed because the bed is on the wall opposite the window under the windowis a small desk with a round forest green cloth stool to sit on to the left ofthe bed is an armoire that holds clothes and other personal belongings tothe right of the bed and across from the armoire is a washstand with amirror and a little vanity table that has a lipstick blush comb—all laid outas if she is coming back      the washstand has a small white porcelain basin on the floorunderneath are two bowls one has cat food and the other water no cat isaround i hope they found a good home for it      i sit on her bed and look through her nightstand in the drawer is alittle notepad that has a rubber band around it holding a pencil tight aquick peek tells me its her expense accounting for rent food and the likethere are no notations for several days before her death but i want toexamine it more at length so i shove it in my purse and continue goingthrough her dresser there is nothing out of the ordinary whatever storiesshe had been working on she apparently hadnt brought them home yetshe would have been working on a number of them at any one time      why cant i find any notes and clippings she was working on shecabled articles every day to new york most often not original stories shewrote but just a rehash of news she found in london papers that she feltwould interest new york readers yet nothing is at her office or in herroom which begs a question why would she—or someone else—get ridof them      either hailey was being overly tidy before she killed herself—and shewas not a slave to being orderly with her work materials—or someone hadcleaned out everything to ensure that nothing would be found      i do find a pretty brooch that i know she liked and stick it in my pocketas a memento      where hailey i look around the room talking maybe haileysghost is lingering about where did you hide the name of the man youwere involved with      it has to be someplace very secretive but where i peek under hermattress under the bed … nothing i rummage through her armoire …nothing i shove a bunch of hangers over to one side and one drops when ithits the bottom of the armoire it makes a dull thud sound      kneeling down i take out shoes and a hatbox and tap the wood itsounds hollow in the far left inside corner is a tiny hole barely enough toput my finger in i lift off the false bottom and inside the recessed area is abook—a diary      jackpot i go straight to the very last entry she has a cryptic noteim going on a journey further in spirit than my feet will carry me      oh no… barely comes from me as i sink to the floor anyonereading this would interpret it as an admission to suicide there is nothingabout bad love or being pregnant … nothing maybe in her previousentries …       she told me shes her sister…       i jump up almost losing my balance the maids voice is pleadingwith someone       you know the rules       that has to be the landlady her voice reeks with authority       i slip the diary into the pocket of my coat       when the queen of hearts walks in im hanging up a blouse notlooking happy that shes out of the rabbit hole       what are you doing in here       without waiting for an answer she grabs the blouse from my hand as ifi had snatched the crown jewels       you might fool my foolish maid but i will tell you the same thing isaid when her socalled brother came nothing goes out til i confirm it withthe police       her brother im baffled by her proclamation about a brother but itdoesnt last long the nasty woman reminds me of nurse grupe who iencountered during my ten days in a madhouse on blackwells island and ihated that woman if she thinks shes going to bully me shes got anotherthing coming she—we dont have a brother       i know she didnt have any family       im her adopted sister and her supervisor at the newspaper we workfor im nellie bly       i dont care if youre the queen of sheba nothing is leaving thisroom im owed rent and this stuff will be sold to cover it as soon as thepolice are finished with their investigation and it wont be enough to coverit let me tell you       ah … i see her heart is beating with that eternal rhythm that hasdriven human beings since the dawn of time—greed       how much is owed my publisher will make good the full amount ofrent i glance around and of course other than the clothes i will need tohave sent over to the funeral home you can dispose of the rest of the itemsas you wish       the womans face softens to the texture of paving stones welltheres many a charity in need i always say       i am sure that in her case charity begins and stays at home       tell me about this man who claimed to be her brother      he was british he told me that they were estranged and i told him allthe more reason he couldnt look through her stuff estranged in my booksmeans you are no longer family      what did he look like      i dont know i wasnt planning to draw his picture he was mediumbuilt long dark hair blue eyes dont really remember anything else norcare as i told you makes no difference who comes and who says whatnothing goes out until i get me rent im tired of people coming in here likeit was a public place first that abberline copper then the one yesterday thatmade a fine mess going through everything now you doing only the lordknows what nothing leaves here til i get me money      very good policy i only left the officer in charge of the investigationinspector abberline a short time ago i have one other question what washaileys mood in those last few days before she died      how would i know i leave my boarders to themselves as long asthey pay their rent on time have no shenanigans in their rooms and be herebefore i lock the doors at night i dont care what their moods are or whatthey do i keep my nose out of their lives      shes lying of course the woman probably spies on her boarders      did she talk to you or any of the other boarders about a particularstory she was working on      no now—      miss… the voice comes from the maid      maggie go attend to your chores      the maid quickly disappears down the hallway      mrs franklin turns back to me and points at the open door and untili see payment you can leave too      ill arrange payment and be back to select the clothing      what a witch—to put it politely—but i know i have gone as far as ican get with her so i leave besides the diary is burning a hole in mythoughts and i need to get somewhere to read it what a find—if a youngwoman is going to confess her life and loves anywhere it will be in hersecret journal      as i step out the front door of the house and start down the stairs ihear miss miss—      the maid comes out the front door behind me and hurries downlooking nervously back at it      you wanted to know about haileys mood she was happy notdepressed and excited we did talk sometimes she told me shed met theperfect man thats why i was so surprised when the police came and foundher note      did she tell you who the man was      no she couldnt      why not      she said she couldnt because he was very important and well knownwith the rich and powerful she said him and her needed time to figurethings out before making their romance public      when did she tell you this      three days before she took her life she came home late and isneaked her in i couldnt help notice she was wearing a beautiful ring iasked who gave it to her and she told me it was a gift from the man sheloved and that i mustnt tell anyone about it it was a secret she also saidshe was going to be moving out that this man was going to take care ofeverything she was so happy      what did the ring look like      it was a ruby surrounded by diamonds … very expensive      she didnt have a ring like that at the morgue if she had it on when herbody was recovered the morgue attendant or someone earlier took it didshe talk to you about any of the stories she was working on      yes yes… she looks back at the front door      its okay shes probably still in haileys room adding up how muchshe can sell everything for      maggie puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh you knowmrs franklin for sure you do about a week before she done herself inmiss mcguire said she was working on a story that would give her … ohwhat was the word … recognition she was so excited but i have no ideawhat it was about im sorry i cant be more help she was always sosecretive about the news stories she worked on but i think i knowsomething maggie uses a confidential tone and glances back again to seeif the boogey woman has reared her ugly head      three or four days before she died i was cleaning her room and ihappened upon an article on her bed stand that she had scribbled on ofcourse i never looked closely at it knowing how she was about keepingthings a secret      of course not what was the article about      a doctor      do you remember the doctors name      no      what about the doctor      some woman lady somebody had died      he killed her      no … i dont know i have to go back in      wait please think do you remember anything about the doctor      she bit her lip hes … hes a health doctor he makes peoplehealthier he was treating the woman with something that wasnt realmedicine and she died ive gotta go      here      i take her hand and put the brooch in it her jaw drops      this is expensive … i cant…      yes now go run before mrs franklin catches you      i too hurry away taking a good deep breath relieved to have gottenaway from that terrible woman i would not have been so kind and gentle toher if i didnt know that she would have taken my tongue lashing out on herpoor servant girl      i take the diary out of my pocket and stick it in my purse once i find acafé i will stop and read the diary over tea and biscuits      my heart pounds … i have haileys diary now i will be able to getanswers      the restraint of not plopping myself down and reading her diary isdriving me nuts but i cant chance the evil queen of hearts watching mefrom an upper floor window to see if i had stolen anything      which i had of course \",\n",
        "    \"archer watches from a hundred feet away as nellie bly comes out of theboardinghouse he picks up his step to stay close enough behind her tomake a quick move if he has to he doesnt want to bring attention tohimself or risk getting his legs chopped off again if she boards a trolley      he gets a jolt as the bly woman pulls a red book out of her pocket andslips it into her purse without looking at it      the diary      it had to be the diary it had that look and color but the furtive wayshe slipped it into her purse was the tipoff that makes him certain shehadnt gotten the book with the landladys permission      how did she get her hands on it      he had bluffed his way into the mcguire womans room yesterday byshowing his old police badge once inside he did a thorough search of theroom he knew from over a dozen years as a copper that women are muchmore clever than men when it comes to hiding evidence but leave it up to awoman to find another womans hiding place      he should have torn the place completely apart even without thepolice badge the old bitch that runs the boardinghouse would have sold himanything he had wanted from the room for a quid      the bly woman turns the opposite direction from the trolley stop asshe comes up to the corner      shes anxious to take a peek in the book going for hot tea and a warmplace to read it good that means she hadnt had time to read it and shewouldnt get her nose between the pages either not on his watch he hasto get it before she reads it that was made very clear to him if he wants toget paid very well      getting this job had been a fluke saving him from the final slip intothe gutter that hed been sliding toward since he had been dismissed fromthe force for taking bribes from a bookmaker to supplement that lousysalary they pay junior detectives      it wasnt his fault he had had a wife who liked luxuries thats howhe kept getting in deeper first for what she wanted to wear and eat and thenshe even demanded he wore expensive suits i aint being seen with a mandressed like a street cop is what she told him so he did the only thing hecould he went on the take looked the other way for a tidy sum from thebookmaker who handled bets on the races and sports as his wifesdemands got bigger and his tastes got more refined he started shakingdown some of the criminals hed collared when one of them tried to turnthe tables by blackmailing he had beaten the man half to death his onlyregret was that he hadnt completed the other half of the beating because thebastard was able to tell a doctor who hed been smacked by and why      if only he had kept his temper down and dumped his wife long agobut he fell hard for her beauty and that she was an actress he neverunderstood why she married him nor did anyone else he was big andburly with a face that had been bashed into too many times over fights hestarted while she was delicate like a china doll she had manners he hadnone      he knew the other coppers were jealous of his gorgeous wife andexpensive habits they constantly were asking him how he did it—withevery one of the bastards knowing and not a few of them also on the take      the money he always had jangling in his pockets aside he knew hehad also made enemies on the force because of his temper his way ofsolving anything right or wrong was to punch hard talking didnt get youanywhere at least thats what he learned from his dad who used his fistsmore than once on archer until archer got big enough to give titfortat      in his mind no one on the force cared that he was taking bribesbecause others were on the take too they just remembered how manytimes he pushed his way in to get what he wanted ratting him out was theirway of getting even      now hes answering to a wealthy aristocrat whos a lot more corruptthan him no one made millions of quid in business without doing thingsunder the table that would make a bank robber look like a saint      he had come into contact with the rich man when he was still on theforce soon after he was promoted to junior detective the mans teenageson was being investigated for beating another boy severely over a girl thefather slipped archer some money and the case got dumped     now the man has another problem a problem the police couldnthandle youll be my consulting detective is what he told archer     archer didnt care about his title all he cared about was the money hewas sick and tired of being poor and he wanted revenge the kind hed getwhen he looked up his exwife and made her green with envy with hispockets full of money hell shove money in her face then to really makeher mad hell lavish it on another actress she knows hes not worriedabout who hell get all actresses are sluts and will do anything for moneyshe did     this book the american woman found in the dead girls room will behis ticket back to the good life he knows something valuable is in itinformation that will make him a wealthy man and if that aristocratic pigwho hired him thinks he is just going to simply turn it over to him for a fewlousy quid—hes in for a big surprise     but first he has to get it from the woman     being the man he is asking her for it politely isnt in the cards                                    13blueeyed brother i mulled over what haileys landlady told me with abritish accent no less now who in the devil is he the elusive lover whyhe would want access to haileys room is the one thing about him imcertain about he wants the diary because there is something in it that willexpose him as her lover and i have the damning evidence      wha— pops out of my mouth as a man comes up from behind megrabs my purse and takes off like a bat out of hell      help help he has my purse i yell at the top of my lungs as i givechase there is no one else in sight on this gray wet day      i only get a glance of him but im positive its the man who made themad dash to get on the trolley near haileys office and got off with me ather boardinghouse      his head goes down and i get the impression hes opening my purse itry to increase my speed but my long dress ridiculous petticoats and bulkyhightopped heeled shoes that encase a woman work against me sprinting      a woman comes out of a food store and the man concentrating on thecontents of my purse runs right into her her grocery bag flies out of herhand exploding as it hits the ground the man stumbles to stay on his feet      my purse flies into the air as he throws it over his head back at me asthe woman he nearly bowled over yells a curse at him      quickly grabbing my purse off the ground i determine that my coinpurse with my gold coins and folded money are inside but something evenmore important is missing haileys diary      whats happened the woman asks me that thief get yourmoney      no not my money      thank god you all right      yes and you      oh im fine cant say the same for me groceries      as we gather up her food the grocer comes out of the store and theychatter about how unsafe the streets are for honest people and the policedo nothing the grocer says      even though i am hearing everything they say none of it penetrates thefog in my brain my god—the diary was stolen taken from me in broaddaylight by a man who must have been following me from haileys office      you sure youre all right the woman asks me again you look likeyouve seen the devil      yes … im okay im just amazed at how devious people are andwhat terrible things rational human beings are capable of      did you hit your head dear      the murky stuff in my head is still there as i am carried away in ahansom cab to my hotel      shocked down to my socks i admit and angry is the lover sodesperate about being exposed that he is resorting to criminal acts itsobvious to me that this is the case and i cant help wondering if there ismore to it than just the mans identity is he also trying to cover up somecomplicity in haileys death did she get that bump on her head before shewent into the water      i dont know whether its a lover trying to avoid scandal or onecovering up murder but i realize that i have been looking for a reason tofind hailey hadnt killed herself almost from the time i got the news in newyork now that i know something is amiss i am confronted with both adilemma and a challenge what can i do about it      im alone in a foreign country thousands of miles from the resourcesand contacts that i can employ whenever i do an investigation and imunder a time pressure the paper expects me to stay only a few days to layhailey to rest and clear up her desk as mr cockerill instructed me afterthat they expected me back beating the bushes for stories      which is another quandary im in do i want to return to the world      their cavalier treatment of me since my return from my trip around theworld has me questioning if i want to continue working for the newspapermr pulitzer and the editorinchief never even said so much as thank youor offered a salary increase or any other reasonable compensation a manwould have received for a similar accomplishment bottom line i did notreceive one cent and my salary has been a very low one      after my insane asylum exposé which i know did not garner a fractionof the publicity and increase in ratings that my trip around the world did ireceived a generous bonus check i have yet to receive one      and not to sound petty but the only thank you i received from mrpulitzer was a cabled congratulation with a note begging me to accept a giftfrom india another item i have yet to receive such treatment would neverhave been given to a man      if i hadnt written around the world in 72 days4 i would be inhorrible financial straights for i am not just taking care of myself i amtaking care of my mother brothers and sister      to make matters worse shortly after i returned my favorite bothercharles died—inflammation of the bowel he was only twentyeight fiveyears older than me5 and that worries me ive been having health issuesmyself and the doctor keeps telling me i need a vacation i thought my triparound the world would be one but instead it was very stressful6 but imustnt think of that for now i have more pressing issues at hand i musthelp provide for his widow sarah and their two small children charles andgertrude after our father died charles and i made a pact always to takecare of each other i will not let him down      so when a book publisher nl munro offered me an incredible threeyear contract to write dimenovel fiction7 in a series of installments for hisweekly new york family story paper—ten thousand dollars for the firstyear and fifteen thousand for each of the next two years8—i couldnt refusewhile this is more than what mr pulitzer will ever offer me reporting thenews is oxygen to my soul and i dont know if im ready to give it up but ido know that healthwise i cant write the books and remain a reporter      my poor head wants to explode but i must focus back on the issue athand—my attacker      the first question is who was the man that attacked me in broaddaylight on a public street hired help i am sure nor did he appear to meto be someone that hailey would have become romantically entangled with      he looked street tough the sort of man youd find in a lowerclass barand hire to do dirty work the kind that the police investigate      i hadnt paid much attention to him when he came aboard the trolleybut reflecting now my impression of him is that while he wore a businesssuit it needed cleaning and some attention from a hot iron indicating to methat he probably isnt married and that he might be down on the heels froma higher position in life than the one he now held      he is hardly the important personage that hailey had boasted about toboth the maid and james the gatekeeper definitely just hired help paid toget the diary and whatever else the lover wanted the covers pulled over butwhat is in the diary that would make haileys lover take the risk of havinghis thug commit a street crime that could send both him and the street toughto prison      the lovers identity or a more serious crime—the murder of hailey      that diary speaks from the grave words that might not be directevidence of murder but might point to the man who made her pregnant andraise questions that would make the police reconsider a simple verdict ofsuicide      then there is the other question eating away at my mind how does thebig story hailey was working on fit in she mentioned doing a major storyto both james and the maid yet i found nothing about it in her room andfound at her office only the red file with just filler stories more importantthan the stories i didnt find were the ashes left behind the onlyexplanation for the burning that my head will accept is that someonepossibly the mugger who attacked me went into her office and burned allevidence of the story      there has to be a connection between the story and the man hailey hadbecome infatuated with that all references to the story were destroyedbecause they led back to the man who wanted his identity kept secret seemsa reasonable conclusion to me but could the two situations be completelyalien to each other a coincidence no way will i accept that the diaryand the news story hailey was working on are linked to haileys lover andher lover obviously has no scruples when it comes to relying on violence toget what he wants i might not have fared as well today if id met that thugin a dark alley      but for the life of me i cant imagine how the lover and the news storycould be linked hailey imitated me in carving out a career in reportingand that meant that inevitably any story that hailey would go overboardabout would involve crime political dirty dealing or other scandalousmatters the world is not a scandal sheet by any means but it did notbecome the circulation champ by being anything but a bareknuckle streetfighter when it comes to the news      my gut tells me i cant go to abberline until i have more evidence hehas the suicide note and i cant tell him what is in the diary as for themugger hell point out that purse snatchings are common instincts in anycity anywhere—and it so happens that london is the most populous city inthe entire world i can almost hear him telling me exactly how many pursesnatchings occur every day in the city—and my retort being of course howmany of them discarded the money in a purse and ran off with a youngwomans diary      his rebuttal will be that the thief got confused and simply startingthrowing things and hed want to know if i continued after the thief to seeif he had soon discarded the diary i didnt and my failure to do so would bethe inspectors coup de grace in the discussion      no a simple purse snatching isnt going to impress him or win himover to my side not without something solid nor will the feelings of amaid and an office clerk that hailey wasnt suicidal since neither was anintimate of haileys      until i have an explanation for the suicide note i cant go to theinspector at the moment the only explanation that sits well with me is thatshe was coerced into writing it under duress unfortunately i have no proofexcept the hairs standing up on the back of my neck and someone muggingme      where to start is not a difficult question for me like hailey i am areporter and know the beat she was working on a story about a medicalscandal involving a health doctor and a highsociety woman so i will startthere and see where it leads me      hopefully the news story and the man in her life who betrayed andprobably murdered her will intersect      i could drop by a newspaper office and ask reporters about recentstories featuring a health doctor and a dead noblewoman but i already havean inside source for london high society and its rumors innuendos andscandals—basically an artery to all that goes on in london society      drop me at the nearest telegraph office i tell the cabbie through thehansom cabs roof door     it is time to contact an old friend one who once fought killers with meand who is not only a worldchampion purveyor of gossip but perhaps alsothe most common subject of gossip in the city and a shameless instigator ofthe most outrageous titillating and racy scandals on the planetyou will find me at the langham under the name of count von kramm     —the king of bohemia from a scandal in bohemia by sir arthur con doyle\",\n",
        "    \"im meeting mr ernest i tell the maître d at the dining room in thelangham hotel the grande dame of hotels in the world and the epitome ofelite chic      im escorted to a table to bide my time while i wait for mr ernestwho is my friend and sometime partner in crime—detection of course—oscar wilde      oscars reply to my telegraph had advised me cryptically that hewould present himself incognito at the restaurant thus the mr ernest bitand would offer explanations that must be kept under the rose it took mea moment to realize that under the rose was an idiom for secrecy datingback to ancient times      as the wit and scandalous rascal of london society both because ofhis sharp tongue and refusal to limit his sexual activities to those dictated byrespectable people and straitlaced religious organizations oscars need tohide out could have arisen from any number of things he said—or did      the fact we were meeting in the most fashionable and exquisite hoteldining room in london at a time when oscar is incognito is merely partof the charm of a man who upon his arrival in america to begin hisspeaking tour advised a customs officer that he had nothing to declare buthis genius      i admit i had been taken in by oscars secrecyladen message butwhen my cab dropped me off where the entrance to the hotel is completelylit with electric lights and the doorman who is waiting to help me down andescort me in is dressed as modestly as the admiral of the royal fleet idecided oscar may be more melodramatic than in danger      my poor stomach grumbles and i mutter where are you oscar as iawait his presence his response instructed me to meet him at tenthirty afashionable time for dinner after plays are over i check my fathers pocketwatch hes five minutes late and there is nothing fashionable about myhealthy appetite      ive never gotten used to chic latenight eating not even after severalyears in new york and im hungry enough to nibble on the wood table inmy hometown of cochran mills pennsylvania population exactly 534 igrew up having dinner at six sharp not hours after the sun has gone down      i almost feel like getting up and going back to roam again in theencased garden atrium its really lovely and so unexpected in downtowngray foggy london they took the inner courtyard and covered it with aniron and glass roof so it can be enjoyed yearround scattered among theflowers and trees are wroughtiron tables and cushioned chairs and benchesso one can sit and gaze at the stars as they sip wine i imagine it must bebeautiful to sit and watch snowflakes fall it would be like being in one ofthose glass balls my mother has that you shake and watch the snow fall onthe animals in a forest      ive traveled the world and seen many gorgeous hotels but never havei experienced a place as elegant as the langham throughout the publicareas they have intricately laid mosaic flooring decorated in white goldand scarlet selectively hanging on walls covered with handprintedwallpaper are moorish murals and silk hangings—each having a story oftheir own to tell white marble pillars that give one the feeling of purewealth are standing guard all about      coming through the grand entrance hanging on the hallway wallleading into the dining area is a persian tapestry carpet that must have cost akings ransom      the dining room is enormous and simply dazzling their wallpaper isa light creamy beige adorned with little golden angels each holding a blackbow and arrow—some shooting arrows and some sitting on fluffy whiteclouds and something ive rarely seen electric chandeliers—thousands ofcrystals of all shapes and sizes lit with lightbulbs there are over a dozen ofthese brilliant lighting fixtures hanging from the fourteenfoot ceiling whichis a highly polished pinkish italian veneziano plaster—or as the italians saythe womens stucco because it burnishes to an even gloss with very littleeffort white marble pillars are scattered among the tables one wall isfloortoceiling glass that overlooks the encased garden all this creates asumptuous atmosphere perfect for eating … which im dying to do      when the maître d took me to my table i paused for a moment andstared at a large stone fireplace with roaring flames on the opposite wallfrom the glass wall—the wood is not being burned a gas fireplace hetells me with ceramic logs      amazing what will they think of next      our table sits right in the center of the room if oscar wantsanonymity this is definitely not going to please him however if i take intoconsideration a pillar which is right by our table oscar might have a littleprivacy from the curious if he is truly planning to appear in some sort ofdisguise      each table is set with floral china sitting on top of silver charger platessterling silverware crystal water and wine glasses a small vase of flowersand a candle in a decorative etched glass candleholder in the center of thetable some settings like mine have a crystal wine holder that looks like aduck      after seeing what other diners are wearing im not happy being in thecenter of the room and find myself leaning toward the pillar to hide thecouture is formal men are in white tie the women in evening gowns somesleeveless with long gloves most with feathered hats and almost everywoman has either a pearl necklace dazzling diamonds—or both      not many months ago i completed a seventytwoday trip around theworld with only one change of clothes that i carried in a small valise yetmanaged to attend shipboard dinner parties without shame i came tolondon with the same valise and the same one change of clothes and thesame lack of embarrassment i work hard and travel fast and light andrefuse to load myself down with trunks in order to look fashionable      if the other women in the world believe they are seeing an uglyduckling crossing the room they are probably right but id like to tell eachof them that i earn my own duck food      i hear a stir and murmuring among the diners and look toward thedoor      there he is in all his glory pausing as he enters i shake my head andsigh incognito      oscar is wearing a green velvet suit with wide lapels a white silk shirtwith a lord byron collar and an oversized red tie that is loosely tied and aswide as a scarf his cape is purple and reaches nearly down to the heels ofhis brilliantly polished black patent leather shoes his hat is black andwould have gone nicely on the head of one of the three musketeers     besides the clothing that would have raised eyebrows at a showing ofalices adventures in wonderland much less at a posh restauranthotel inthe heart of londons west end everything about oscar is big—sixfootthree soft and flabby with a low mezzo voice that people concentrated tohear yet reaches across a room his mind is big too encyclopedic histongue a guillotine that cuts through hypocrisy and affronts with a razoredged blade     he excitedly waves his hand as he weaves around a sea of tablescoming toward me with as much subtlety as shermans march on atlanta—no make that moses crossing the red sea oscar is carrying a white
