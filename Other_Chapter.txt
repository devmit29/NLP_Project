My hands are shaking as I hold Hailey’s suicide note. Inspector Abberline is gracious enough to turn his head and look out the window.
If anyone can recognize Hailey’s handwriting it’s me. I’ve seen enough of it. I believe that Inspector Abberline has alternative motives for getting the suicide note to me. He also wants to make sure it’s Hailey’s because of my reluctance. Like he said to me at the morgue, “Just an added point of confirmation that confirms her identity…”
I take a deep breath and look down. “Oh no.”
“It’s not Hailey’s handwriting?”
“No … it’s hers.”
He nods his head and looks back out the window.
Tears roll down my cheek as I read her letter. I am so sorry for what I am about to do, but my life is no longer worth living. He’s left me and I have nothing to live for. I feel so lost, alone, I don’t know what to do. There is no way I can go back to America. I can’t bear the thought of prison. No, I can’t and I won’t go back. I have no place to go and no one to live for. There is only one thing I can do. Whoever finds this note please make sure my cat is given a loving home. Hailey McGuire.
